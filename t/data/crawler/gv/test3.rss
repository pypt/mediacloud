					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 4th of June, there were more than 150,000 Hong Kong citizens gathered in and around the Victoria Park to commemorate the 20 anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. The number of attendees has broken the record since 1990, telling the world that Hong Kong people have not given up the demand for vindication of June 4th. However, more than half of the local newspapers and the most viewed TV station decided to downplay the news.</p>
		<p>ESWN <a href="http://www.zonaeuropa.com/200906a.brief.htm">collected the front page of local newspapers on June 5</a>. Among the 13 Chinese newspapers, only 4 had placed the candle night vigil on the frontpage. Headline News and Sing Pao put the passing away of a local actor Sek Kin on the front page; Hong Kong Commerical Press and Hong Kong Economic Journal put up the interview of the future-to-be CEO of Hong Kong stock exchange; Sing Tao, Hong Kong Daily News, Oriental Daily and the Sun highlight stories on youth&#39;s deviant behavior - drug abuse and sex work. Wen Wei Po stressed Chinese government&#39;s favorable polices to Hong Kong. Below are the images of the 4 cover stories (via ESWN):</p>

		<p>Apart from printed papers, T.V company&#39;s self-censorship have more pervasive effect in Hong Kong as television broadcasting sector is highlight monopolized because of the government&#39;s license policy. There are currently only 2 over-the-air commercial television station in Hong Kong, TVB and ATV, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVB">the Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) alone</a>, has taken up 80% of viewership. In recent year, there are more and more criticisms saying that the TVB&#39;s news department has been harmonized (adopting self-censorship).</p>
		<p>On June 4, the TVB Jade (Chinese) channel placed the candle night vigil in the third news item and outraged many people. A citizen took action to protest against the TV news department by holding a slogan in front of the camera when the reporter was having live report. Here is the youtube record:</p>
		<p><object width="560" height="340" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/i5HxQRaUZTM&amp;hl=zh_TW&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/i5HxQRaUZTM&amp;hl=zh_TW&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
		<p>The paper banner said:</p>
		<blockquote><p>無線新聞　事事旦旦</p></blockquote>
		<div class="translation">TVB news, a sloppy production</div>
		<p>Erynnyes from <em>those were the days</em> commented on <a href="http://thosewerethedays.wordpress.com/2009/06/06/%e5%85%ad%e5%9b%9b%e7%85%a7%e5%a6%96%e9%8f%a1%ef%bc%9acctvb%e5%8f%8a%e5%85%b6%e4%bb%96">TVB news June 4th report</a>:</p>
		<blockquote><p>昨天最多人討論的新聞，恐怕不是六四燭光集會有多少人参加，不是梁洛施為李澤楷產子相爆光，就是CCTVB在六四燭光集會新聞直播中，被在場市民舉起抗議牌，批評「無綫新聞、事事旦旦」！A對童工說，據聞CCTVB領導人袁花志偉，對事件怒不可遏云云，但正如A說，天作孽，猶可恕，自作孽，不可活，袁花志偉當日如何處理趙紫陽回憶錄新聞、以至CCTVB在六四當日，如何把六四新聞，放在當日6:30新聞第三段，市民、觀眾，可是看在眼裡，CCTVB所作所為，有沒有人為他們辯護？</p></blockquote>
		<div class="translation">Yesterday the most discussed topic was probably not how many people had attended the June 4 candle night vigil, not Richard Lee&#39;s private life, but the protest banner of &#8220;TVB news, a sloppy production&#8221; shown during the CCTVB&#39;s live broadcast. My friend A told me that the CCTVB news department leader Yuen Chi Wai was very angry about the incident. But as my friend A said, we could not complain about the heavenly disaster but this is a man-made choice. It is so obvious even to ordinary people that Yuen Chi Wai had downplayed the release of Zhao Ziyang memoirs. On June 4, CCTVB even placed the news to the third news session. How can anyone defend for what it had done?</div>
		<blockquote><p>要平反六四，首要守住香港的新聞自由，若連新聞自由也守不住，還談甚麼爭取平反六四、爭取香港民主？若香港傳媒也在自我審查的時候，還期望誰為港人發聲？CCTVB、亞視淪為中央台，只是一個開始，香港人是時候，為香港傳媒盡點力，悍衛香港媒體，不會被阿爺和諧掉！</p></blockquote>
		<div class="translation">If we want to vindicate June 4, we need to defend press freedom. If we failed, there is no way to strike for June 4 vindication and democracy. If local press practice self-censorship, how can we expect Hong Kong people to voice out? Now that CCTVB and ATV has fallen into CCTV, this is only a start. Hong Kong people have to defend local media to protect them from central government&#39;s harmonizing pressure.</div>
		<p>He pointed out that the arrangement was not a careless mistake but a well thought arrangement <a href="http://thosewerethedays.wordpress.com/2009/06/08/%e6%88%91%e5%b0%8dcctvb%e5%85%ad%e5%9b%9b%e7%95%b6%e5%a4%a9%e8%99%95%e7%90%86%e6%96%b0%e8%81%9e%e7%9a%84%e6%83%b3%e6%b3%95%e5%92%8c%e5%9b%9e%e6%87%89">that completely against professional journalistic judgment</a>:</p>
		<blockquote><p>六四當日CCTVB六點半新頭條是「天水圍三男生疑濫藥於公園暈倒」，這個，童工還可以認為說得過去，二條可是「立法會通過盡快興建西港島線」！那只是立法會內交通事務委員會之下的鐵路事宜小組委員會會議決定！首先，當日CCTVB報道這段新聞，稱這個委員會做「鐵路事宜委員會」，已有誤導之嫌，立法會內眾多事務委員會，何來一個「鐵路事宜委員會」？那只是交通事務委員會內，一個小組委員會吧了！重要性有多大？童工可以說，CCTVB平日，連正式事務委員會會議也不會報道，為何六四當日，會把一個事務委員會轄下小組委員會決議，放在六四15萬人燭光集會之前？</p></blockquote>
		<div class="translation">On June 4, the headline of CCTVB in 6:30pm is &#8220;three boy fainted in a Tinshiuwai park due to drug abuse&#8221;. Well, this can still be considered a piece of news. However, the second item is &#8220;Legco has passed the motion to construct Hong Kong island western subway line&#8221;. That motion was only passed by a discussion group on railway affair of the transportation committee of the Legislative Council. It isn&#39;t any railway affair committee in the Legco, the report is misleading in the first place. The so-called committee is just a discussion group within the transportation affair committee. What is the significance of such news? Usually CCTVB won&#39;t even report on standard committee&#39;s meeting, why then decided to put the discussion group&#39;s decision before the June 4 candle night vigil where 150,000 people had attended?</div>
		<p>Netizens started making fun of TVB by calling it CCTVB, a sister company of its China counterpart CCTV. In the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=83303283333">facebook</a>, a group was formed to protest against CCTVB and netizens have designed new logos for it:</p>

					<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday night, French media announced the death of President <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Bongo">Omar Bongo</a> of Gabon, who had spent 41 of his 73 years in power. French newspaper Le Point <a href="http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-politique/2009-06-07/au-pouvoir-depuis-41-ans-le-president-gabonais-omar-bongo-est-mort/917/0/350399">reported</a> that they received news of his death, by cancer, in a private clinic in Barcelona, through a &#8220;source close to the President&#39;s entourage&#8221;. AFP, on the other hand, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gmh-vG8pht1d7rLFZ0CaiagGuLNw">reported</a> a French governmental source. But later Prime Minister Jean Eyeghe Ndong told Gabonese TV that he had been &#8220;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8088382.stm">very surprised</a>&#8221; to read the reports.</p>
		<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78977" title="Omar Bongo" src="http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/omar-bongo.jpg" alt="Omar Bongo" width="440" height="302" /></p>
		<p>When Omar Bongo was admitted in Barcelona&#39;s Quirón clinic earlier in May, a comment by Akin a the <em>African Loft</em> <a href="http://www.africanloft.com/omar-bongo-is-the-end-near-for-africas-longest-serving-tyrant/#comment-42737">predicted</a> his death away from his subjects:</p>
		<blockquote><p>The greatest indictment of his lamentable regime of 42 years is that Gabon does not have hospitals that could treat either himself or his wife.</p>
		<p>What kind of leadership is one that cannot bring any appreciable benefits to its people whilst the leaders jet off to foreign lands for the slightest sign of discomfort?</p>
		<p>This is an indictment that applies to probably the whole of African leadership, the inability to raise the standards of infrastructure, education, health and opportunity.</p>
		<p>When would we be able to make all leadership really accountable for their years of disservice?</p>
		<p>[&#8230;] The morale of this sordid tale is unAfrican in its context, the king shall not die in his palace surrounded by his subjects who “adore” him but in a non-descript expensive hospital room surrounded by strangers.</p>
		<p>A king that fails to rule with probity will die in a distance in disgrace with everyone breathing a long sigh of relief - Good riddance! To them all.</p></blockquote>
		<p>Togolese blogger Rodrigue Kopgli, of <em>Jeunesse Unie pour la Démocratie en Afrique</em> [Fr], <a href="http://lajuda.blogspot.com/2009/06/omar-bongo-un-des-vieux-crocodiles-de.html">called Bongo</a> &#8220;one of the last crocodiles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Françafrique">Françafrique</a>&#8220;:</p>
		<blockquote><p>Ami de tous les gouvernements français depuis De Gaulle, Albert-Bernard Bongo devenu El Hadj Omar Bongo puis Ondimba (le peuple lui réclame du changement démocratique, il lui offre des changements de nom personnel), n’a jamais cessé d’être l’Agent des Services secrets français qu’il était à sa prise du pouvoir. Fort de sa longévité et de la fortune amassée au sommet du Gabon, Le Hadj s’octroie le luxe de financer des campagnes électorales en France notamment celle de François Mitterrand comme l’a écrit Pierre Péan dans « Affaires africaines ». Il laisse aussi un gigantesque parc mobilier et immobilier en France et des comptes bancaires secrets qui bien évidemment font et feront le bonheur des paradis fiscaux qui les hébergent. Le peuple gabonais pendant ce temps manque de tout. Avec un tel bilan, la terre ne lui sera pas légère du tout. Et les Africains qu’il prétendait cyniquement représenter ne se mettront pas en deuil, non plus.</p></blockquote>
		<div class="translation">Friend of all French governments since De Gaulle, Albert-Bernard Bongo, who later became El Hadj Omar Bongo and then Ondimba (the people were asking for democratic change, he offered them personal name changes), he never stopped being the French secret service agent that he had been since he came to power. With his longevity and fortune amassed in power, the Hadj afforded himself the luxury of financing electoral campaigns in France, in particular that of François Mitterrant as written by Pierre Péan in &#8220;African Affairs&#8221;. He&#39;s also leaving gigantic real estate assets and private property in France, and secret bank accounts that are making the tax havens where they are hosted very happy. Meanwhile, the Gabonese people are lacking everything. With this legacy, he will not be missed at all. And the Africans that he was cynically pretending to represent will not mourn him either.</div>
		<p>Citing Togo&#39;s experience, Kopgli doubts Bongo&#39;s death will bring change:</p>
		<blockquote><p>La mort de Bongo n’apportera rien de salutaire au peuple gabonais, car les héritiers Ali et Pascaline Bongo sont déjà positionnés et portés par Bolloré – ami personnel de Sarkozy – et de Christophe de Margerie de TotalFinaElf et de bien d’autres vampires pour capter le pouvoir, comme ce fut le cas du Togo où les fils du défunt Gnassingbe ont été portés au pouvoir sous le double poids du viol et des violences.</p></blockquote>
		<div class="translation">Bongo&#39;s death is not going to bring anything beneficial to the Gabonese people, because the heir and heiress Ali and Pascaline Bongo have already been groomed and brought by Bolloré -personal friend of Sarkozy- and of Christophe de Margerie of TotalFinaElf and many other vampires to suck power, as it was the case in Togo where the children of the late Gnassingbe were brought to power under the double weight of rape and violence.</div>
		<p>Ivorian blogger Théophile Kouamouo [Fr], who also mentions Togo, ponders about what will happen after Bongo&#39;s death and <a href="http://kouamouo.ivoire-blog.com/archive/2009/06/08/omar-bongo-la-fin-d-un-dinosaure.html">wonders about the future of the Françafrique</a>:</p>
		<blockquote><p>Maintenant que le &#8220;patriarche&#8221; n&#39;est plus, l&#39;on entre dans l&#39;ère des incertitudes et des questionnements. Le schéma constitutionnel - remise du pouvoir à la présidente du Sénat puis élections - sera-t-il respecté ? Va-t-on vers un schéma de bataille fratricide à la togolaise [&#8230;]? L&#39;armée gabonaise, totalement invisible, entrera-t-elle en scène ?</p>
		<p>Puis profondément, quel est le bilan d&#39;Omar Bongo Ondimba ? Après sa mort, la Françafrique, dont il était le pilier, s&#39;affaiblira-t-elle ? Pour ma part, je pense que oui - mais peut-être que je m&#39;avance trop. Ce système-là était trop centré sur un certain nombre d&#39;hommes, de petits secrets, de règles de départ qui n&#39;existent plus, pour perdurer éternellement.[&#8230;]</p>
		<p>La Françafrique s&#39;affaiblira, mais la démocratie avancera-t-elle ? L&#39;Afrique se retrouvera bientôt face à son destin et aux contradictions de son Histoire. Personne ne l&#39;aidera à en démêler les noeuds. Mais observons d&#39;abord ce qui se passera dans les prochains jours au Gabon.</p></blockquote>
		<div class="translation">Now that the &#8220;patriarch&#8221; has passed away, we are entering an era of uncertainty and questioning. The constitutional outline -power transfer to the President of the Senate and then elections-, is it going to be respected? Are we going to fall into fratricidal fighting like in Togo [&#8230;]? Is the Gabonese army, completely invisible, going to enter the scene?</p>
		<p>More profoundly, what is the legacy of Omar Bongo Odinma? After his death, is the Françafrique, of which he was the pillar, going to weaken? Personally, I think so - but maybe I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. This system was too focused on certain men, on little secrets, on exit rules that don&#39;t exist anymore, to last forever. [&#8230;]</p>
		<p>Françafrique will grow weaker, but will democracy move forward? Africa will soon be faced to its own destiny and to the contradictions of its history. Nobody will help her to untie the knots. But let&#39;s first observe what will happen in the next days in Gabon.</p></div>
		<p>Emmanuel Bellart of Cameroon [Fr] <a href="http://atelier.rfi.fr/forum/topics/il-est-mort-le-doyen-de-la">expressed</a> his relief:</p>
		<blockquote><p>Dieu merci, car un autre est parti, l&#39;afrique commence à respirer petit à petit, il ne fallait plus que ça pour que l&#39;afrique puisse finalement ouvrir les yeux, monsieur omar bongo qui a mit 41 ans au pouvoir, ce qui est iraisonnable nous a montré combien ces vieux de la france voulaient vraiment detruire l&#39;afrique, c&#39;est claire que personne ne doit souhaiter la mort d&#39;un être humain, mais d&#39;un côté, c&#39;est un soulagement pour le peuple gabonais, sauf qu&#39;il y&#39;avait une chose que monsieur bongo devait faire, c&#39;est organiser le pouvoir et non de le preparer pour ses enfants [&#8230;]</p>
		<p>adieu le doyen, laissons le pouvoir au peuple et non à une personne, quand tu t&#39;accapare du pouvoir , tu meurs et on t&#39;oublit</p></blockquote>
		<div class="translation">Thank God, another one is gone and Africa is starting to breathe little by little. That&#39;s all we needed for Africa to be able to open her eyes at last. Mr Omar Bongo spent 41 years in power, which is unreasonable, he showed us how much those old Frenchmen really wanted to destroy Africa. It&#39;s obvious that nobody wishes the death of another human being, but on the other hand it&#39;s a relief for the Gabonese people, except that there was something that mister Bongo needed to do and it was organize power instead of grooming his children [&#8230;]</p>
		<p>Goodbye the most senior [dictator], let&#39;s leave the power to the people and not to one person, when you monopolize all power you die and we forget you</p></div>
		<p>At the newsportal Gaboneco [Fr], a Gabonese reader named Ogwera <a href="http://gaboneco.com/editcomment.php?article=13825">left a comment</a> asking for democratic elections:</p>
		<blockquote><p>Je suis un citoyen gabonais et j&#39;exige des élections dans le strict respect de la constitution de La République!!!! et je dis non à ceux qui appelle la france à se mêler de la politique gabonaise notamment BEN MOUMBAMBA qu&#39;on ne connait pas et qui pourrait être un pion de cette france! Les gabonais doivent s&#39;unir et rester vigilants!</p></blockquote>
		<div class="translation">I&#39;m a Gabonese citizen and I&#39;m demanding elections in the uttermost respect of the constitution of the Republic!!! and I&#39;m saying no to those that are calling for France to meddle in Gabonese politics, in particular Ben Mouamba whom we don&#39;t know and who could be a pawn of France! Gabonese must unite and remain vigilant!</div>

Much criticism and discussion is also taking place about the disrespectful way in which the media have been covering the loss of the lives of the 228 on board, and the lack of information regarding the disaster.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The French airbus that vanished from radar on Sunday on its way from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, has caused much grieving, question marks and, of course, media speculation. Air France flight number <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447">AF 447</a> took off from Brazil on Sunday 31th of May with 216 passengers and 12 crew members and was expected to arrive at its destination the next day. It never arrived.</p>

<div id="attachment_78648" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AF_447_path-en.svg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-78648" title="Flight path of Air France Flight 447 on 31 May/1 June" src="http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/358px-af_447_path-ensvg-300x237.png" alt="Picture by Mysid (Wikiedia Commons author), used under a public domain license." width="300" height="237" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Picture by Mysid (Wikiedia Commons author), used under a public domain license.</p></div>
<p>Authorities say 58 Brazilians were killed in the crash. But on some Brazilian blogs, the debate is about the media coverage of the disaster. For <em><a href="http://leitedecobra.blogspot.com/2009/06/voo-447.html ">Leite de Cobra</a></em> [pt], the way in which the non-arrival of the airbus and supposed disaster has been treated is outrageous:</p>
<blockquote><p>Acho perverso isso da imprensa ficar divulgando fatos e particulares da vida das vítimas do desastre aéreo. Não têm o mínimo respeito e nem disfarçam o desejo de que a dor renda, em escala nacional, o máximo possível, até que venha a próxima catástrofe, o próximo escândalo. Ô corja! Por isso que não acompanho mais nada desse triste episódio. Pra mim deu</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">I think the media is perverse when releasing news and private information about the disaster victims&#39; lives. They don’t have the least respect for the victims and they don’t even conceal their desire that the pain lasts, in national proportions, as long as possible, until the next catastrophe, the next scandal, arrives. Oh vultures! That’s why I won’t follow anything else about this case. I&#39;ve had enough!</div>
<p>According to bloggers, the problem is that the media always wants to report something and prove it right, come what may -  creating theories and enhancing sensationalism. <em>Camerini</em>, from blog <em><a href="http://transbrasil.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/voo-447-pode-ter-tido-problemas-em-zona-intertropical/">Transbrasil</a></em> [pt], states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Os experts de plantão já estão desfilando as baboseiras nas Tvs.</p>
<p>Falam e falam sobre o que ainda não passa de especulações, até Raios são culpados pela queda do AirBus da Air France !</p>
<p>É prematuro qualquer indicação sobre o acidente até que as equipes consigam, primeiro localizar os destroços do avião, depois a Caixa Preta, com o Data Recorder e o Voice Recorder, mas, como dá audiência levar para a Tv um bando de especialistas natos em acidentes aéreos, o que se pode fazer!</p>
<p>Ouvir um Chamar o avião da Air France de Boeing A 330, outro dizer que o Atlântico é o lugar mais seguro do sistema solar , depois outro que afirma categoricamente que um raio derrubou o avião!</p>
<p>A Verdade é que ninguém sabe ainda o que aconteceu, aonde aconteceu e como aconteceu, mas muitos especialistas deveriam saber que um acidente aéreo não ocorre apenas por uma só causa, e sim por mais fatores que desencadeam um acidente</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">The round the clock experts have already been talking a lot of rubbish on TV.</p>
<p>They have talked and talked about things that are just speculation. Even lightning has been blamed for the Air France plane crashing!</p>
<p>It’s too early to indicate anything about the accident until the rescue groups can first find the aircraft debris, and the black-box, with the data and voice recorders. But as bringing a bunch of naturally-born-specialists to TV attracts a large audience, what can be done!</p>
<p>I have heard one of them calling the Air France aircraft a Boeing A330, another one saying that the Atlantic Ocean is the safest place in the solar system, and then, another one emphatically affirming that lightning knocked the aircraft down!</p>
<p>The truth is that nobody knows what has happened, where it has happened and how it has happened, but many specialists should know that an air accident doesn’t happen for just one reason, but because of a series of factors which cause an accident.</p></div>
<p>For <em><a href="http://shimarina.blogspot.com/2009/06/sobre-as-teorias-que-surgem-agora.html">Eu, Você e Todo Mundo</a></em> [pt], the desperate search for specialists is also a problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gente, que absurdo!</p>
<p>Eu como jornalista fico indignada mesmooo!!! Aqui no Futura recebemos o e-mail de uma assessoria de Campinas falando de uma terapeuta holística que analisou a catástrofe desse acidente pela numerologia, tarô. Enfim, de acordo com o texto dela que vou colocar abaixo, essa catástrofe é efeito da conjunção de uma série de números ruins, energias negativas&#8230; pra mim é demais querer explorar uma tragédia como essa dessa maneira. Que vergonha&#8230; e ainda dos jornalistas que se propõem a divulgar isso! Vejam o absurdo:</p>
<p>Detalhe: não estou julgando a numerologia, mas o uso que está se fazendo dela nesse caso!</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">Guys, how absurd! As a journalist myself, I do indeed feel outraged!!! Here on the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-166186655.html">Futura channel</a> we have received an e-mail from a PR office located in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campinas">Campinas</a>, in which a holistic therapist analyzed this catastrophe using numerology and taro. Anyway, according to that press release, the catastrophe is the result of a conjunction of factors such as bad numbers, bad feelings… I think it is just too much to explore such a tragedy in this way. What a shame…. Also shame on the journalists, who publish it! See absurd: I’m not judging the numerologist, but the way she has been used in this case.</div>
<p>With a very controversial comment which raises the much discussed issue that <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/11/brazil-when-climate-change-meets-cyber-activism/">some disasters are considered more important</a> and newsworthy than others according to the social class of those involved, <em><a href="http://psysapiens.posterous.com/voo-447-nada-de-novo-so-mais-do-mesmo">Bruno Nepumoceno</a></em> [pt] reached the following conclusion, after talking to people at work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fui dar minha opinião sobre o assunto e nego ficou me criticando, dizendo que eu não tenho coração, que eu sou insensível e coisas do tipo. A vontade que deu e de dizer: VOCÊS QUE SÃO BURROS OS SUFICIENTE PARA NÃO ENXERGAR QUE O JORNALISMO GANHA DINHEIRO EXPLORANDO A DESGRAÇA ALHEIA! Se fosse um ônibus cheio de nordestinos com a mesma quantidade de pessoas, o caso já teria caido no esquecimento.<br />
Centenas morrem de fome no nordeste Brasileiro. O que é um aviãozinho cair?</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">I spoke my mind about the subject and the guys criticized me, saying that I am heartless, that I have no feelings for such news as this. In fact, what I wanted to say is the following: YOU ALL ARE STUPID ENOUGH NOT TO REALISE THAT THE MEDIA MAKES MONEY BY EXPLOITING OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S MISFORTUNE! If it was a bus full of people from northeast [of Brazil], the case would have been forgotten. Thousands of people die of hunger on the African Continent. Hundreds die of hunger in the Brazilian Northeast. What is the big deal with a little aircraft crashing?</div>
<div id="attachment_78657" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caribb/504845634/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-78657" title="Air France A330-200 F-GZCE" src="http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/airbus-a330-300x199.jpg" alt="Photo by Flickr user Caribb published under a Creative Commons license" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo of an Air France A330 by Flickr user Caribb published under a Creative Commons license</p></div>
<p>Nevertheless, there is an intense wave of grief and shock around the world, and naturally Brazilian bloggers are not the only ones discussing the accident online. From Kuwait, the blogger <em><a href="http://www.zdistrict.com/2009/06/02/air-france-447-tragedy/">ZDistrict</a></em> summed up his feelings.</p>
<blockquote><p>228 people from Brazil to France on an Air France flight has vanished over the Atlantic after flying into turbulence. I haven’t seen a tragedy such as this in a long time, a flight of this type crashing in the middle of the Atlantic.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://www.zdistrict.com/2009/06/02/air-france-447-tragedy/#comment-233389">Charles</a></em>, a commenter on ZDistrict has this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fear, helpless, horrific moment - it brings tears and heart ache to hear anyone enduring that final moment. Really hope they were all asleep during all that moments. Its over now, their faith bring them to where they belong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenter <em><a href="http://www.zdistrict.com/2009/06/02/air-france-447-tragedy/#comment-233367">Another Me</a></em> states:</p>
<blockquote><p>i’m so sad for the families. i fly frequently and can’t imagine what the passengers must have felt, not to mention the families. i also have an infant and that just breaks my heart to think of that innocent little baby, unaware of what’s happening. in my opinion, the governing international aviation athority (whoever that is) needs to restrict pilots from flying through or above thunderstorms, and require that they fly around all storms. those storms can reach upward of 50,000 ft; trying to fly above is just too risky.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many times, air tragedies occurring over the Atlantic Ocean have been associated with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>, which is located north of Brazil, between Florida (USA), Puerto Rico and Bermuda. Still from Kuwait, Twitter user <em>@<a href="http://twitter.com/2twentythree3/statuses/1995737255”">2Twenty3 </a></em>suggests that the &#8220;Bermuda triangle needs investigating&#8221;.<a href="http://twitter.com/2twentythree3/statuses/1995737255”"><br />
</a></p>
<p>Cynthia Drescher, blogging at the <em>Britannica Blog</em>, <a href="http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2009/06/is-air-france-flight-447-lost-in-the-bermuda-triangle/”">says</a> that the lack of information regarding the disaster will bring out conspiracy theorists, and many have alredy tried to link the crash with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>…[T]he skeptics would like to heighten the drama by associating the Bermuda Triangle with this recent mystery. What’s next — asserting that the Triangle is now some sort of giant trapezoid? Perhaps the mysterious area got bored with hanging out off the US coast and decided to journey to Brazil for some caipirinhas?<br />
Although authorities haven’t yet confirmed that the floating seats are indeed from the missing Air France jet, it’s pretty easy to see on the map above that for once, this possible tragedy has nothing to do with aliens or electromagnetic fields or the ghost of Amelia Earhart. It does, however, have everything to do with freak accidents and airplane safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not forgetting the Bermuda Triangle effect, Polish blog <a href="http://tierraincognita.blox.pl/2009/06/Katastrofa-Air-France.html"><em>Tierra Incognita</em> </a>[pl], wonders what has happened, affirming that despite the  catastrophe of the disappearance, he stills loves flying:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Uwielbiam latać samolotem</strong>. Podróż lotnicza nie wywołuje u mnie żadnego stresu, wręcz przeciwnie – działa uspokajająco i relaksująco. W chwili gdy maszyna odrywa się od ziemi wpadam w specyficzny błogostan, mam wrażenie że wszystkie moje problemy i zmartwienia pozostały tam na dole. Świadomość, że przez najbliższe kilka godzin podróży będę w zupełnie innym wymiarze, gdzie w sumie nic ode mnie nie zależy, sprawia mi wielką frajdę. Jak dziecko, godzinami mogę gapić się przez okienko, nawet jeśli to czarna noc i widać tylko gwiazdy.</p>
<p>Zastanawiam się dlaczego ten właśnie wypadek aż tak bardzo wlazł mi pod skórę? Złożyło się na to pewnie kilka czynników – Air France jest jednym z moich ulubionych przewoźników, dosłownie kilkanaście dni temu odprowadzałem bliską przyjaciółkę na samolot lecący z Caracas do Paryża, a ja sam też na trasie Ameryka Południowa – Europa latam dość często. No i jeszcze ta tajemniczość tej katastrofy – nie żadne „tradycyjne” kłopoty przy starcie, bądź lądowaniu, ale zaginięcie gdzieś na środku oceanu. Dobrze, że przynajmniej nie nad Trójkątem Bermudzkim&#8230;</p>
<p>Na szczęście nie sądzę aby ten wypadek zmienił mój stosunek do latania. Nadal się cieszę, że prawdopodobnie jeszcze w tym miesiącu będę musiał kilka razy wsiąść do samolotu. I wciąż mam nadzieję, że jeszcze w tym roku uda mi się dolecieć samolotem do Księżyca&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation"><strong>I love flying on air planes</strong>.  The air travel is not stressful to me at all, on the contrary - it relaxes me and calms me down. The moment the machine stops touching earth I get into a specific state of peacefulness, I have a feeling that all my problems and troubles are left below. The thought of being stuck for the next few hours in a completely different dimention where nothing really depends on me, is really cool. Like a kid, I can stare through the window for hours, even if its nighttime and all I can see is stars. I wonder why exactly this accident touched me so deeply? Probably there are a few reasons - Air France is one of my favourite companies, just a few days ago I walked my close friend for a flight from Caracas to Paris, and I myself very often travel on the line South America - Europe. And the whole  mystery surrounding this catastrophe – not the &#8216;usual&#39; problems with take off or landing, but disappearance somewhere in the middle of the ocean. Good job it didn&#39;t happen over the Bermuda Triangle&#8230; Luckily I do not think that this accident will change my attitude towards flying. I am still happy that I will most probably have to sit  on a plane a few times this month. And I hope that this month too I will be able to catch the plane to the Moon.</div>
<p>Discussions and rumours have begun to focus not only on the strange weather patterns in the part of the Atlantic where the plane went down, but also on the computer systems on the Airbus A330-203. Specifically, some are investigating the coincidences between the Air France flight and an October 2008 Quantas flight headed for Perth, Australia that dropped 200 meters in a matter of minutes, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing. Others <a href="”http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/australian-airbus-incident-unlikely-to-be-relevant-to-air-france-disaster-2009-06-03“">argue</a> this incident is not relevant to the recent disaster. From <a href="http://blogs.crikey.com.au/planetalking/2009/06/03/af447-mid-air-breakup-evidence-raises-new-discussions-about-the-last-signals-sent-to-paris">Plane Talking</a>, written by Ben Sandilands  at <em>Crikey Blogs</em> in Australia.</p>
<blockquote><p>It has been reported by The Aviation Herald, an online Europe based journal of aviation incidents and news that the main body of electronic alerts begin with the disengagement of the autopilot and were followed by messages related to the ADIRU or air data and inertial reference units and the PRIM or flight control primary computer which is informed about speed, attitude and other material flight values by the ADIRUs.<br />
Superficially this resembles the onset of the mid air upset that caused Qantas flight QF72 from Singapore to Perth to make an emergency landing in Learmonth last October.<br />
The PRIM will in some flight modes intervene in the flight controls settings of the jet to inhibit pilot inputs which would exceed critical limits which could stall the airliner, or overload parts of the structure or control surfaces on the wings or rudder.<br />
However these limitations can also be in turn locked out by the pilot.<br />
Other reports indicate that these ‘unprecedented’ messages were concentrated in a four minute period, ending with a final advisory message about the vertical speed, that is, the rate at which the jet was falling rather than any speed with which it was also moving forwards.<br />
Faulty ADIRU units in the Qantas A330-300 operating the flight that diverted to Learmonth remain a major focus of an unfinished air accident investigation by the ATSB. That investigation is also looking at other ADIRU related incidents on Qantas A330s.<br />
However the Qantas ADIRU units were made by Northrop Grumman, while those in the Air France jet were made by Honeywell, They are two completely different designs, running totally different sets of programmed logic to serve the same ends.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the passengers whose lives were claimed by the crash were French: there were 61 French passengers and 11 French crewmembers. Charles-guy de Kerimel, the writer of the aviation history blog <a href="http://pdlaviation.unblog.fr/2009/06/02/vol-air-france-rio-paris/"><em>Des avions et des hommes</em> expresses his condolences</a> [fr] to the passengers and the crew of the Airbus A330-203.</p>
<blockquote><p>L’annonce de cet accident me remplit de tristesse.<br />
Le plus grave accident d’Air France, nous dit-on.<br />
Indépendamment du nombre de victimes, pour chacun de ceux qui sont concernés la gravité est extrême, pour la victime bien sûr, mais aussi pour les parents, les amis, les collègues : ils se trouvent brutalement confrontés à une perte irrémédiable. Je m’associe à leur peine. Je songe au personnel d’Air France ; en premier lieu aux navigants, comme leurs aînés ils vont poursuivre leur tâche.</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">The announcement of this accident fills me with sadness.<br />
This is Air France’s most serious accident, we are told…<br />
Regardless of the number of victims, for each of those involved it is extremely serious for the victim, but also for parents, friends, colleagues: they are suddenly faced with an irreparable loss. I feel their pain. I think of the staff of Air France; first of Airmen, their elders as they continue their work.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As expected, US President Barack Obama&#39;s speech was received with different and contradicting reactions in the Egyptian blogosphere. While many praised his eloquence, charisma, intelligence and awareness of Arab and Islamic history, more believed it was just the same talk they had heard from other presidents but in a better wrapping. Also, they almost all agreed they are waiting for &#8220;action&#8221; to prove the supposed &#8220;good intentions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first <a href="http://blog.ahmedsays.com/2009/06/blog-post.html ">optimistic opinion</a> came from <em>Ahmed</em>, who said how happy he is with Obama&#39;s gesture of approaching the Islamic world: </p>
<div class="arabic">في النهاية أنا متفاءل فلم تكن أروع طموحاتي تذهب إلي أن يتكلم رئيس أمريكي بهذه اللهجة الأقرب إلي الحياد ولا بهذه المفاتحة الأدني إلي الاعتذار.</div>
<div class="translation">At the end, I am optimistic. My highest ambition was not even to have a U.S. president speaking in this manner, neutral in a way that is more like to apologizing.</div>
<p>Another blogger, <em>Ahmed Shokier</em>, <a href="http://shokeir.blogspot.com/2009/06/blog-post_05.html">analyzed</a> Obama&#39;s speech, then advised his readers that Obama is neither Muslims&#39; grand Imam nor a Muslim himself to have high expectations of him. He also said that the speech wasn&#39;t targeted towards Muslims only, but was followed by American voters, Israelis and non-Muslims as well. </p>
<p><em>Shokeir</em>&#39;s other observations included: </p>
<div class="arabic">
ثالثاً : لكي يتم تقييم الخطاب يجب النظر في طريقة التعامل السابقة لأسلافه ومامدى الحال والهوان الذي وصلنا له في علاقاتنا معهم<br />
رابعاً : لن يأتي الرجل ليقدم لنا الحلول والمساعدات ويرحل ، فهو ليس بابا نويل ولا روبين هود ، فالعلاقة متبادلة أن تأخذ وتعطي أن تمنح وتهب<br />
خامساً : نحن أمة إستهلاكية مفككة وليس لها أي تأثير ولا ثقل دولي لا في مجال علمي أو تكنولوجي أو عسكري أو إقتصادي</div>
<div class="translation">Third, to assess the speech fully, you have to take into consideration the treatment of the previous administrations and and the level our relationship has deteriorated to.<br />
Fourth, this man did not come to present us with solutions and aid and then leave. He isn&#39;t Santa Claus or Robin Hood. Relationships are mutual and there is give and take.<br />
Fifth, we are a fragmented society which consumes goods only. We have no international impact or influence. Nor do we have any scientific, technological, military or economic power. </div>
<p>In reply to <em>Shokier</em>&#39;s post, <em>Desert Cat</em> <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/12993155430740490922 ">offered</a> a different opinion:</p>
<div class="arabic">هو بما انى مش كنت حاطة اى امل ولا حتى فكرت اتوقع خطاب اوباما لانى مدركة ان مش فى فرق بين احمد والحاج احمد لكن دمى محروق اوى على ال500مليون جنيه اللى اتصرفوا على 6 ساعات قضاهم معاليه فى القاهره</div>
<div class="translation">Although I had no high hopes in his speech, and I didn&#39;t try to speculate anything - because I know there is no difference between him and any other American president but I was enraged because of the 500 million pounds which were spent on the six hours he spent in Cairo.</div>
<p>The same comment by <em>Desert Cat</em> was seconded by another female blogger, <em>Fattractive Egyptian woman</em>, <a href="http://fattractive.wordpress.com/2009/06/05/obama-mania/">who did not appreciate</a> the preparations taken by the government for the visit:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like many people, I wasn’t exactly on top of the world when Obama chose Egypt to speak from. Oh, of course, prestige, we’re the best country in the world, blah blah, but what about all the abuses and less-than-democratic procedures we have here?</p></blockquote>
<p>She then added a comic by <a href="http://drsherif.net/index_art.php?viewkar=1&amp;other=1&amp;comtype=2&amp;otherid=314&amp;image=1088.jpg"><em>Sherif Arafa</em></a>, an Egyptian writer, about how the whole Cairo cleanness is going to end  as soon as Obama takes off his plan:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>After Obama’s Visit (Upper left hand corner and clockwise):<br />
1) Return [the palm] tree to the storage area.<br />
2) Of course the exams get postponed for the guests, do you think we’re at Harvard?<br />
3) The governor left?<br />
4) I saw someone practicing politics in the university sir, his name is Obama!<br />
5) We must return everything to it’s place.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Adel</em>, a 23-year-old blogger, took a break from his studies for the final exam to follow the speech. Like many others, including <em><a href="http://resstlesswaves.blogspot.com/2009/06/blog-post.html ">Blue Stone</a></em> [Ar], <a href="http://talafef.blogspot.com/2009/06/blog-post.html">Mahmoud25x</a> [Ar], <a href="http://www.tahyyes.org/2009/06/blog-post_1934.html">Nawara Negm</a> [Ar], GVO author <em><a href="http://marwarakha.blogspot.com/2009/06/power-of-obama-smile.html">Marwa Rakha</a></em> -who thought the magic of the speech lied in Obama&#39;s charming smile- and <a href="http://khly-dafyrk.blogspot.com/2009/06/blog-post.html">Doaa</a> [Ar], he believed Obama was trying to flirt with and please all parties, and that his talk will not lead to any change. He <a href="http://elbald-dy.blogspot.com/2009/06/blog-post_04.html ">Quoting </a><em>remarks</em>: </p>
<div class="arabic">معتقدش ان كلامه ده هيتنفذ و السبب اننا سمعنا نفس الحوارات دي و مش معني انه جالنا هنا يبقي الراجل بيحبنا .. ده بس عندهم تصليحات في البيت الابيض […]فقالك ازور الهرم و اتصور جنبه و ااقولي كلمتين و اخلع عشان الحق الغداء .</div>
<div class="translation">I don’t think his words will be translated into action, and the reason is because we’ve heard such talk before. And it is not because he came to us, that he is someone who loves us. In fact, they are currently conducting some  “maintenance” work in the White House […] so in the meanwhile, he thought of passing by, visiting the pyramids and taking some pictures, followed by a quick lunch and then depart.</div>
<p><em>Fattractive Egyptian woman</em> continued in her excellent post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, he said all the right things. He quoted verses from the Qur’an. He said al-salamu Alaykum. He said Islam contributed a lot to western civilization. He proudly said he had Muslim roots. [&#8230;]<br />
The rhetoric was beautiful. So beautiful that many people missed—or chose to ignore—the fact that nothing much has changed. [&#8230;] US policy has remained the same. America’s interests are still number one, and that is to be expected.</p></blockquote>

<p>On a different note, while <a href="http://egyptianchronicles.blogspot.com/2009/06/obama-speech-what-i-think.html"><em>Zeinobia</em></a> compared Obama to the late John F Kennedy, the <a href="http://arabist.net/archives/2009/06/04/obama-2009-nixon-1975/"><em>Arabist</em></a> compared his visit to Nixon&#39;s back in 1975; others - like <em>Egyptian citizen</em>, went a step further and compared his speech to that of the late Egyptian president Anwar El  Sadat in the Israeli Knesset in 1977, before the Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. For them, both of the two presidents were calling for peace.</p>
<p><em>Egyptian Citizen</em> <a href="http://stories-from-my-life.blogspot.com/2009/06/1977-2009.html">published</a> videos for both speeches, then commented:</p>
<div class="arabic">السادات قالها من 1977   و الان اوبما يقولها  في 2009<br />
فهل من مجيب؟<br />
يهمني الفعل مش كلام<br />
نفسنا نعيش من غير  حروب و دمار و ارهاب<br />
امتى نعيش في سلام عادل ؟<br />
stop war and live in peace<br />
الخطاب دة فكرني  بالسادات الله يرحمة<br />
فعلاً كان رجل لة روئية   و نظرة للمستقبل
</div>
<div class="translation">Sadat said it in 1977, and now Obama repeats in 2009. Would someone respond?<br />
I care for what’s to be done, not said. We want to live without wars, destruction or terrorism.<br />
When will we live in just peace?<br />
Stop war and live in peace.<br />
This speech reminded me of Sadat (God rest his soul in peace)<br />
He was a man of vision, and an insight for the future.</div>
<p>Another blogger, <em>Ha&#39;er fi donia Allah</em>, <a href="http://4egypt.tadwen.com/?p=347 ">tackled</a> the topic from a different perspective. He was worried about the health condition of Egyptian president Mubarak, because he didn&#39;t receive Obama from the airport:</p>
<div class="arabic">هل رأيتم السيد أوباما وهو يصعد للطائرة أمس؟؟… شاب قوي صحيح مثل هذا هو ما ينبغي له أن يقود أمة قوية…….. أما السيد الرئيس فهو لم يستقبله حتى في المطار رغم كونه أهم شخصية في العالم الآن والبروتوكول يقول أن الرئيس يستقبل الرئيس، ولا أعتقد أن الرئيس لم يستقبله في المطار لأن الرئيس الأمريكي في العادة لا يستقبل الرئيس المصري في المطار أثناء زياراته السابقة، يبدو أن الرئيس “تعبان” وليس لديه استعداد لبذل أي مجهود بدني، فوفاة حفيده ودواعي الزمن عليه تنبئ بصحة تنتكس بصورة ملحوظة…</div>
<div class="translation">Did you see Mr. Obama boarding the plane yesterday? A strong man such as this should lead a strong nation. But our president didn&#39;t receive him at the airport, despite him being the most important figure in the whole world and the protocol says a president receives a president. I don&#39;t think its because American presidents usually don&#39;t receive the Egyptian president in previous visits, but because our president is &#8220;tired&#8221; and not ready to make any physical effort. His grandson&#39;s death, and the passage of time, have had a toll on his health.</div>
<div id="attachment_78656" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 389px"><a href="http://www.sandmonkey.org/2009/06/04/the-speech/"><img class="size-full wp-image-78656" title="Demo against Obama's visit" src="http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/3595541774_5f328f45a3.jpg" alt="3595541774_5f328f45a3" width="379" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sandmonkey who attended the event, wrote his observations  behind the scenes, then mentioned a small demonstration that took place in front of Cairo University.</p></div>
<p><em>Fattractive Egyptian woman</em>, concluded her post with a glimpse of optimism:</p>
<blockquote><p>So that’s my two cents. The question remains, is Obama really and truly sincere in his words? Or is he, as this editorial puts it, simply another Napoleon, a man who “appropriated Islam in order to advance [his] own material interests at the expense of local populations?”</p>
<p>But even though I’m a cynical person, that doesn’t mean I’m still not hopeful. We’ll have to wait and see, as everyone is saying, if Obama can walk the talk. Intentions matter, but without actions, they don’t mean squat.</p></blockquote>

		<description><![CDATA[The continuing tense situation in the Amazon Region of Peru has taken a turn for the worst with reports of clashes between indigenous protestors and the police.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The continuing tense situation in the Amazon Region of Peru has taken a turn for the worst and has become unbearable in city of Bagua. Reports coming from that area are truly alarming: RPP says: <a href="http://www.rpp.com.pe/2009-06-05-emergencia-en-bagua-policias-mueren-y-pobladores-destruyen-inmuebles-noticia_186075.html">Emergency in Bagua: Police are killed and residents destroy buildings [es]</a>. El Comercio reported that demonstrators <a href="http://www.elcomercio.com.pe/noticia/296546/manifestantes-quedan-locales-estatales-apra-bagua-grande">burned government buildings [es]</a>, as well as the Apra political party headquarters in Bagua Grande. There are no official reports of deaths of indigenous residents, but SERVINDI does mention: <a href="http://www.servindi.org/actualidad/12430">Peru: 20 Awajún-Wampis indigenous die during conflicts in Bagua [es]</a>. </p>
<div id="attachment_78662" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/bagua.jpg"><img src="http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/bagua.jpg" alt="Photo of Conflict in Bagua by TV Cultura and used under Creative Commons license. http://www.flickr.com/photos/tvcultura/3597959493/" title="bagua" width="400" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-78662" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo of Conflict in Bagua by TV Cultura and used under Creative Commons license. http://www.flickr.com/photos/tvcultura/3597959493/</p></div>
<p>These protests are<a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/07/peru-indigenous-communities-continue-protests/"> a continuation of the demands from indigenous communities,</a> who are concerned that the government will take away their lands that are believed to be rich in minerals and oil.  As a result, more than 2,000 indigenous residents have been blockading the highway in the area of Devil&#39;s Curve in Bagua Grande for the past week and a half, <a href="http://enlacenacional.com/2009/06/05/enfrentamiento-entre-policias-y-nativos-en-bagua-deja-tragico-saldo/">according</a> to <em>Enlace Nacional [es]</em>. As a result, supplies have been running out in the area.</p>
<p>One of the indigenous leaders of the protest group, Alberto Pizango, called a press conference and stated that the Peruvian government has committed genocide with the murder of his indigenous brothers and sisters.  Bloggers and twitterers from across the country are quite concerned and have been tuning in to the recent developments.</p>
<p>Many twitterers are following along to reports from the area, and providing their own opinions about the situation using the hashtag #Bagua:</p>
<p>Jonathan Sanchez <a href="http://twitter.com/maskus/status/2045385258">@Maskus</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Pizango no quiere responder por los policias muertos ni la quema de locales #bagua</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">Pizango does not want to answer about the police officers killed or buildings burned # bagua</div>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/xaxo6v/status/2045475967">@xaxo6v</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>#Bagua recuerdan lo que sucedió cuando sacaron a invasores de los bosques de pomac? será que hay &#8220;infiltrados&#8221;? o policia solo dispara?</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">remember what happened when they removed those that invaded the forests of Pomac? could there be &#8220;infiltrated&#8221;? or do the police just shoot? #Bagua </div>
<p>Javier Vargas <a href="http://twitter.com/javier_vargas/statuses/2045450065">@javier_vargas</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Si los nativos no están armados, ¿quién mató a los policiías? @Peru21pe #Bagua</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">If you the natives are not armed, then who killed the Police? @Peru21pe #Bagua</div>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/elguillle/status/2044860804"> @elguillle</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Para Alan lo de #Bagua es pura manipulación de los enemigos extranjeros del país. &#8220;Quieren ver al Perú arrodillado&#8221; Alan dixit</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">For Alan (García), #Bagua is pure manipulation by the foreign enemies of the country. &#8220;They want to see Peru kneel&#8221; said Alan</div>
<p>Miguel Angel Tavera <a href="http://twitter.com/pe1us0/status/2044775714">pe1us0</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Ya no hay medicamentos en el hospital, falta de sangre y muchas necesidades más, necesitan mucha ayuda en Bagua Grande.</p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">There are no medicines in the hospital, there is a lack of blood and many more needs, they need much help in Bagua Grande.</div>
<p>In the blogosphere,  Isabel of <em>Las Burbujas Recargadas [es]</em> <a href="http://burbujasreloaded.wordpress.com/2009/06/05/mueren-nueve-policias-y-20-nativos-hasta-el-momento/">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Esto va a acabar mal. De hecho, ya está yendo bastante mal. Entre Brack, que ya se vendió descaradamente, y Pizango, a quien no le importa mandar a su gente a que la maten mientras él se esconde haciéndose el interesante, no veo ninguna remota posibilidad de entendimiento. Mientras, ¿alguien se preocupa por algo más importante que la politiquería y el dinero, o sea, por LAS VIDAS de los nativos y de sus familias? Claro que tienen derecho a protestar y defenderse, pero cerrando caminos y sitiando a poblaciones urbanas (como Yurimaguas), no se van a ganar el apoyo de nadie. Lo único que van a ganar es el odio y la marginación de parte de sus propios paisanos: están acentuando la división nativos-mestizos,</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="translation">
<p>This will end badly. In fact, it is already going pretty badly. Between (Environmental Minister Antonio) Brack, who has already sold out, and (indigenous leader) Pizango, who does not mind sending his people off to be killed, while he hides, I do not see any remote chance of understanding. Meanwhile, does anyone care about anything more important than politics and money or for the lives of the indigenous and their families? Of course, they have the right to protest and defend themselves, but by blocking roads and placing urban populations under siege (such as  Yurimaguas), they are not going to win the support of anyone. The only thing that will gain is the hatred and marginalization from their own countrymen: they are deepening the divide between indigenous and mestizos</p>
</div>
<p>Paco Bardales of <em>Diario de Iqt [es]</em> <a href="http://diariodeiqt.wordpress.com/2009/06/06/la-selva-en-llamas/">compiles a list of links and will continue to update his blog</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Desafortunado o no, el conflicto amazónico ha tomado un cariz trágico y sangriento. Los sucesos de Bagua han desbordado, mucho más allá de lo permitido. Hasta el momento, el enfrentamiento entre habitantes de la zona y miembros de la Policía, en la llamada Curva del Diablo (luego de que se quemara la gobernación del lugar), están dejando un saldo no confirmado aún de 28 civiles muertos y 10 policías. </p></blockquote>
<div class="translation">Unfortunate or not, the Amazonian conflict took a tragic and bloody turn. The events of Bagua have spilled over, far beyond what is permitted. So far, the confrontation between the residents of the area and members of the police at Devil&#39;s Curve (after the governor&#39;s place was burned) is leaving behind 28 civilian and 10 police deaths, unconfirmed.</div>
<p>In addition to the conflicts in Bagua Grande, clashes are taking place in Jaén in the department of Cajamarca. <a href="http://twitter.com/Cyberjuan/status/2046615398">Several</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/Miztica/status/2045467736">twitterers</a> have been posting news heard on the radio.  With the seriousness of the situation, many Peruvians are wondering what will happen next.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From being described as the &#8220;self-appointed world leader&#8221; to questioning his choice of speech venue to choosing to turn a deaf ear to his speech, blogs across the Middle East are reacting to US President Barack Obama&#39;s policy speech on the Middle East just delivered in Cairo, Egypt. </p>
<p>After listening to the speech, <i><a href="http://stilettosinthesand.blogspot.com/2009/06/54-minutes-and-22-seconds.html">Stiletos in the Sand</a></i>, an American based in Saudi Arabia, writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>54 minutes and 22 seconds .. of my life I can never get back. Speech in Cairo by the jeja is here in four separate parts. Really no reason for any other leaders of the world to continue ruling their own little domains. The jeja seems to have it all under control and will be the first, self-appointed, world leader from hereon out. Oh, sure. He says everything he has aspirations for, that he thinks can be achieved in the world, will need to be done &#8220;together.&#8221; Don&#39;t believe him for one single skinny second. If his lips are moving, he is lying. Hoo Boy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Syrian <i><a href="http://khaldounjarbou.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/hello-world/">Khaldoun Jarbou</a></i> too wasn&#39;t impressed but writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t see any thing new in Obama’s speech, more than that, anyone who kept up with his campaign he/she will notes that this speech is a collection of what he had said before in his way to the White House, but how ever I have liked his choosing of some words. I mean in that Violence and Extremist instead of Terrorism and Terrorist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bahraini <i><a href="http://mahmood.tv/2009/06/05/obama-the-time-to-deliver-is-now/">Mahmood Al Yousif</a></i> wonders out aloud on the speech venue: </p>
<blockquote><p>I keep asking myself why did Obama choose the most repressive regimes in the Middle East to honour not only with his presence, but also to use as a launchpad for his Utopian vision of a peaceful and democratic Middle East? A vision that will continue to remain as illusive as a desert mirage for us Middle Eastners.</p>
<p>Then I try to select an alternate of the 22 Arab countries where he could have used instead, but I fail to find a single one which could be worthy of such an occasion.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the speech itself, <i>Al Yousif</i> adds: </p>
<blockquote><p>Regardless, he touched the perennial issues; Palestine through to women’s rights, freedom of expression to democratic governments and of course the rejection of terrorism and freedom of belief. Points which generally have been raised by every single American president - and world leader for that matter - albeit without such eloquence and empathy - but so far without any concrete steps to see through their resolutions. Somehow a “shared interest” creeps in and all those promises get shelved or forgotten to be revived upon a new ascension to a throne. </p></blockquote>
<p>Writing at <i><a href="http://www.mideastyouth.com/2009/06/04/why-i-didnt-listen-to-obamas-speech/">Mideast Youth</a></i>, fellow Bahraini <i>Esra&#39;a</i> explains why she did not tune into the speech: </p>
<blockquote><p>As an Arab and a Muslim, there was nothing much I can benefit from what Obama has to say. I’m so tired of these tedious speeches and words and praises and promises that no one, including the target audience, ever lives up to. Despite not watching this speech due to lack of interest, I sat down on Twitter and was franly disgusted at the hype, the way people were mindlessly cheering his words on, as if they don’t understand the sources of our issues to begin with. Suddenly Obama was here to “fix things,” while reducing our problems to the size of a footnote.</p>
<p>I support Obama, at least in comparison to his war-mongering colleagues. But we don’t need his leadership, or anyone else’s for that matter. </p></blockquote>
<p>In Israel, writing at <i><a href="http://southjerusalem.com/2009/06/the-june-4-lines/#more-1274">South Jerusalem</a></i> <i>Gresghom Gorenberg</i> notes how the speech has changed history: </p>
<blockquote><p> Barack Obama likes to change what history means, and that’s a very good thing.</p>
<p>Today, for instance, marks 42 years since the Six-Day War began. Ever since then, the term “June 4 lines” has referred to the  on-the-ground border between Israel and its Arab neighbors on the eve of the war - not the lines marked on maps, but the lines marked by forward military positions. On the Syrian front, for instance, the actual positions lined up with neither the pre-1948 international border between Palestine and Syria, nor with the 1949 armistice agreements. The small distances on the ground make for big problems in peace negotiations.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, however, June 4 means something entirely different. It now refers to the day on which Barack Obama chose to speak in Cairo. “June 4 lines” henceforth mean the line of thinking that the president laid out for reconciliation between the U.S. and the Muslim world, and along the way, between Israel and the Palestinians.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the speech, <i>Gorenberg</i> writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>His message to us was very, very basic Obama: First, I acknowledge your history. Second, it’s time each of you recognize the other’s side history, that you stop thinking that somehow by admitting the other’s side suffering you’ll erase your own. And now that you’ve acknowledged history, stop holding on to it as if electricity were running through it, as if your hand can’t let go. Move forward. Turn history into history - the text explaining how we got here - and stop treating it as an ever-repeating present.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/thumb.jpg"><img src="http://globalvoicesonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/thumb.jpg" alt="thumb" title="thumb" width="150" height="229" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-78600" /></a>Do you want to show support for Myanmar opposition leader and global democracy icon <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=15745">Aung San Suu Kyi</a>? A new website was launched last week where anyone from around the world can leave a 64-word message of solidarity for imprisoned leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The website <a href="http://64forsuu.org/">64forSuu.org</a> is named as such to mark Suu Kyi’s 64th birthday on June 19.</p>
<p>Supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi can <a href="http://64forsuu.org/about.php">leave and view</a> video, text, twitter and picture messages on the website. A <a href="http://64forsuu.blogspot.com/2009/05/64forsuuorg-global-campaign-to-free.html">sample</a> of 64-word message of support: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Nineteen years ago, the Burmese people chose Aung San Suu Kyi as their next leader. For most of those 19 years she has been kept under house arrest by the military junta that runs the country. We must not stand by as she is silenced again. Now is the time for the international community to speak with one voice: Free Aung San Suu Kyi.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This brief statement was signed by many personalities and other <a href="http://64forsuu.com/gallery.php?type=5">famous names</a> which included George Clooney, Sec. Madeleine Albright, Drew Barrymore, David Beckham, Bono, Matthew Broderick, Sandra Bullock, John Cusack, Matt Damon, Robert De Niro, Václav Havel, Helen Hunt, Anjelica Huston, Scarlett Johansson, Nicole Kidman, Ashton Kutcher, Madonna, Sarah Jessica Parker, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Naomi Watts.</p>
<p><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23assk64">Twitter</a> is an integral part of the campaign:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is the first political campaign to use twitter with an integrated website to harness the reach and influence of some of the world’s <a href="http://64forsuu.blogspot.com/2009/06/celebrities-back-64forsuuorg-on-twitter.html">most influential celebrities</a>. Through replies and re-tweets, the campaign message reached an estimated 5 million people through Twitter alone in its first five days.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of those who tweeted support for Aung San Suu Kyi was <a href="http://twitter.com/yokoono/status/1935794571">Yoko Ono</a>.

<p>Brown’s 64 words of support:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I add my voice to the growing chorus of those demanding your release. For too long the world has failed to act in the face of this intolerable injustice. That is now changing. The clamour for your release is growing across Europe, Asia, and the entire world. We must do all we can to make this Birthday the last you spend without your freedom.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Many Southeast Asians also expressed support for Aung San Suu Kyi. From Erich Jao of the Philippines:</p>
<blockquote><p>The free people of the world support your cause and the nobility of your sacrifice to further the freedom of Myanmar. Let this year be the last time you breathe the air of oppression and tyranny. Evil shall never thrive in light and let the world cast the spot light of truth upon your fight and let it not be delayed in acting swiftly!</p></blockquote>
