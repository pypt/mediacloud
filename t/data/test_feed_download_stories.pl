<p>On May 14th a <a href=\"http://meganao.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/ato-contra-o-ai-5-digital/\">protest</a> [pt] against the <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2006/11/11/holding-the-line-for-internet-freedoms-in-brazilian-cyberspace/\">Digital Crimes Bill</a> proposed by Senator Azeredo to typify crimes on the Internet took place in S\x{e3}o Paulo to promote debate. On May 25th, it was time for a <a href=\"http://www.softwarelivre.org/news/13553\" target=\"_blank\">demonstration</a> in Porto Alegre. On June 1st, a similar protest happened in Minas Gerais and a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mega_nao/status/2092707194\">new one is being planned</a> now in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These protests have been called \x{201c}Against the Digital AI-5\x{201d} after the Brazilian dictatorship&#39;s Institutional Act Number Five or \x{201c}<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-5\">AI-5</a>&#8220;, the fifth, and considered the most cruel, of seventeen decrees issued by the military dictatorship in the years following the 1964 coup d&#39;\x{e9}tat in Brazil. Issued in 1968, AI-5 abolished freedom of expression by introducing the preliminary censorship of music, films, theater and television. Any work considered subversive to the political and moral values of the country was censored and artists jailed. AI-5 marked the transition to the toughest period  of human rights violations in Brazilian history.</p>
<p>All over Brazil, mobilization against the proposed bill has been organized by a group of bloggers, who have put together a manifesto, a <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mega_nao\">Twitter account</a> and <a href=\"http://meganao.wordpress.com/\">Mega N\x{e3}o!</a> [Mega No!, pt], a blog created with the single purpose of gathering information and contributing to clarify what this bill might mean for Internet users in the country:</p>
<blockquote><p>A proposta do Mega N\x{e3}o, \x{e9} ser um meta manifesto, um agregador de informa\x{e7}\x{f5}es e de diversas manifesta\x{e7}\x{f5}es na Internet e fora dela, com o objetivo de combater o vigilantismo. Diversos n\x{fa}cleos ciberativistas est\x{e3}o surgindo e aumentando o discurso e a press\x{e3}o popular contra o vigilantismo, tenta agregar, fomentar e ajudar a divulgar estes eventos \x{e9} a nossa proposta, nos informe de seus movimentos, vamos juntar for\x{e7}as!!!</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">Mega N\x{e3}o&#39;s aim is to be a meta manifesto, a place to gather information about the various protests on the Internet and outside it, with the aim to fight surveillance. Many cyberactivist groups are emerging and increasing both the discussion of and popular pressure against vigilantism. To try to aggregate, foster and help promote those demonstrations is our main goal. Tell us about your demonstrations, let&#39;s join forces together!</div>
<p>An <a href=\"http://www.petitiononline.com/veto2008/\">online petition</a> against the Digital Crimes Bill released back in 2008 has already gathered 146,627 signatures. Users of Orkut, one of the most popular online social networks in Brazil, have also entered this fight, since many of the demands of this bill are related to this specific social network. One of many related communities, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.orkut.com.br/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=59842273\">N\x{e3}o ao projeto de Azeredo</a>&#8221; [No to the Azeredo Bill, pt], has already attracted 6,563 members.</p>
<p>Activists are also using Twitter as an informative tool for their meetings and collaborative blogging about the subject: the hashtags <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=meganao\">#meganao</a> and <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=ai5digital\">#ai5digital</a> are usually used by bloggers and tweeters and represent a source of information for those seeking updates on how to contribute to the campaign. In addition to this, many of the demonstrations&#39; organizers, supporters and enthusiasts can also be found on Twitter, such as <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/caribe\">\@caribe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/pauloteixeira13\">\@pauloteixeira13</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/samadeu\">\@samadeu</a>, <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/arlesophia\">\@arlesophia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/myris\">\@myris</a>. To keep track with all the details on the repercussions of the demonstrations and the Azeredo Bill itself, people are also using <a href=\"http://delicious.com/\">Delicious</a> tagged bookmarks to gather information in <a href=\"http://delicious.com/tag/meganao\">one place</a>.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact is that mainstream media has not been covering this situation satisfactorily. For many Brazilian bloggers and Internet users, it looks like the media outlets, in addition to Internet companies and the government, are willing to see the bill approved, so that they will have control over what people say and do all over the Web. Antonio Arles (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/arlesophia\">\@arlesophia</a>) comments on this in his <a href=\"http://www.arlesophia.com.br/?p=545\">blog</a> [pt] and stresses how the Internet is useful to gather information about the demonstrations:</p>
<blockquote><p>Participei (presencialmente ou via Internet) de pelo menos tr\x{ea}s atos este ano em que a Rede foi importante para a organiza\x{e7}\x{e3}o, difus\x{e3}o e transmiss\x{e3}o: o Ato contra a \x{201c}Ditabranda\x{201d} da Folha, o Saia Gilmar e o Ato Contra o AI-5 Digital. E \x{e9} justamente essa possibilidade de exerc\x{ed}cio da cidadania um dos motivos da ades\x{e3}o dos oligop\x{f3}lios midi\x{e1}ticos ao AI-5 Digital. A l\x{f3}gica \x{e9} a mesma da dos \x{f3}rg\x{e3}os de repress\x{e3}o do Imp\x{e9}rio Sovi\x{e9}tico ou da Ditadura Civil-Militar Brasileira. Apesar de usaram a m\x{e1}scara de \x{201c}democratas\x{201d} - usando argumentos como o da liberdade quando seus interesses est\x{e3}o em jogo, tentando confundir \x{201c}liberdade de imprensa\x{201d} com \x{201c}liberdade da empresa\x{201d} -, os oligop\x{f3}lios midi\x{e1}ticos s\x{e3}o fruto de uma ditadura. Em \x{fa}ltima an\x{e1}lise, s\x{e3}o uma das faces da Ditadura Civil-Militar que continuam vivas depois da redemocratiza\x{e7}\x{e3}o. A quest\x{e3}o \x{e9} que, para al\x{e9}m dos interesses econ\x{f4}micos, a tentativa de criminaliza\x{e7}\x{e3}o e de aprofundar vigilantismo na Internet \x{e9} uma tentativa de manuten\x{e7}\x{e3}o do monop\x{f3}lio da informa\x{e7}\x{e3}o/opini\x{e3}o e, conseq\x{fc}entemente, do poder.</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">I have participated (in person or online) in at least three demonstrations this year for which the Internet was an important organizational, promotional and broadcasting tool: the action against the &#8220;<a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/03/07/brazil-uproar-over-newpapers-editorial-on-mild-dictatorship/\">Ditabranda</a>&#8221; editorial of Folha de S\x{e3}o Paulo newspaper, the Fora Gilmar [a protest calling for Chief Justice  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmar_Mendes\">Gilmar Mendes</a> to leave Brazil&#39;s Supreme Court] and the action against the Digital AI-5. And this possibility of exercising our citizenship is actually one of the reasons for the mass media&#39;s support of the Digital AI-5. The logic is the same as those of the suppression apparatus of the Soviet Empire or Brazilian Dictatorship. Although they wear the masks of democrats - arguing about freedom when actually their interests are at stake, and trying to confuse &#8220;press freedom&#8221; with &#8220;company freedom&#8221; - the mass media companies are a child of the dictatorship. In the last case, they are the faces of the civic-military dictatorship that live on after the re-democratization. The point is: beyond their economic interests, the attempt to criminalize and deepen vigilantism on the Web is actually an attempt to keep the monopoly of information/opinion and, consequently, of power.</div>

<p>Whether this bill will be passed or not, it seems that the main aim of the Brazilian authorities is to indulge international copyright companies. In an interview for the <a href=\"http://www.direitoacomunicacao.org.br/novo/content.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5045\">Observat\x{f3}rio do Direito \x{e0} Comunica\x{e7}\x{e3}o</a> blog [Observatory of the Right for Communication, pt]  Paulo Teixeira, a PT [Labour Party] member of parliament for S\x{e3}o Paulo, stresses:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ele pretende (o Projeto de Lei Azeredo), em primeiro lugar, introduzir no Brasil uma coisa que alguns pa\x{ed}ses est\x{e3}o introduzindo e que no Brasil, na minha opini\x{e3}o, n\x{f3}s n\x{e3}o dever\x{ed}amos permitir que se introduzisse. Ele est\x{e1} querendo introduzir os mecanismos de controle da internet para a garantia do direito autoral.</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">It (the Azeredo Cybercrimes Bill) intends, in the first place, to introduce in Brazil a practice that many countries are adopting, and that in our country, in my opinion, we should not let happen. It aims to introduce strict Internet control mechanisms to guarantee copyright perpetuation.</div>

Now it is up to activists, cyberactivists and Internet users to fight against the Digital Crimes Bill with even more strength. Otherwise, the Brazilian Internet might be turned into a place where people are guilty before they have even realized what they are being charged with.</p>

            'description' => "<p>Homosexuality is perceived as a new phenomenon in Africa and a taboo. It is outlawed in many African countries. Many African leaders have condemned homosexuality as being un-African. The Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe once described<a href=\"http://www.newzimbabwe.com/pages/powell41.13819.html\"> gays as worse than dogs and pigs</a>. Former Namibia&#39;s President, Sam Nujoma, <a href=\"http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/takeaction/resourcecenter/88.html\">once stated that</a> &#8220;Homosexuals must be condemned and rejected in our society.&#8221; </p>
<p>Nigeria introduced a bill in 2007 banning same sex marriage. <a href=\"http://rodonline.typepad.com/rodonline/2007/01/nigeria_prepare.html\">According to Rod 2.0</a> the bill is the most comprehensive homophobic legislation ever proposed in the world. Early this year homosexuals in Nigeria <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200903120143.html\">stormed the National Assembly </a>seeking for legislation that will guarantee the protection. </p>
<p>Lifestyle, culture and religion have become the invisible fence to many homosexuals in Africa barring them from their freedom of sexual expression. A Kenyan blogger, <a href=\"http://wildeyearnings.blogspot.com/\">Wilde Yearnings</a>, <a href=\"http://wildeyearnings.blogspot.com/2009/06/colour-me-impressed.html\">was quite optimistic </a>after US President Barack Obama officially declared June being a gay pride month and decriminalizing of homosexuality all over the world earlier this month. He posted Obama&#39;s speech on his blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>My Administration has partnered with the LGBT community to advance a wide range of initiatives. At the international level, I have joined efforts at the United Nations to decriminalize homosexuality around the world&#8230;NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2009 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. I call upon the people of the United States to turn back discrimination and prejudice everywhere it exists.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href=\"http://queeryoung.blogspot.com/\">Naughy Feeling</a> <a href=\"http://wildeyearnings.blogspot.com/2009/06/colour-me-impressed.html?showComment=1243962067469#c8734662213807852226\">commented on the post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is great our comrades in America are getting recognition. In our dear country we can&#39;t stick our necks in the sand and tell ourselves all will be well. The gigantous task ahead demands of us that we kid not ourselves of the responsibility ahead of us. It may require sacrifices but all for the greater good. May God bless LGBT kenya n give us strength for what is ahead. But hey, look on the bright side, we can still have fun at it.</p></blockquote>
<p>But will culture, religion and lifestyle factors derail the decriminalisation of homosexuality in most African countries or will it be as Wilde Yearnings described &#8220;meanwhile in Kenya&#8230; The struggle continues&#8230;&#8221;?</p>
<p>It has been said that homosexuality is a lifestyle  adapted by Africans from the West, <a href=\"http://http://afrogay.blogspot.com/\">SebaSpace</a> a Ugandan blogger <a href=\"http://http://afrogay.blogspot.com/2009/06/gay-lifestyle-versus-being-gay-what-is.html\">tries to points out that his &#8220;sexuality&#8221;  and &#8220;him &#8221; are one,</a> that homosexuality cannot be a lifestyle because for him to be involved with someone it has to be sexually, emotionally and spiritually bringing the fact that homosexuality is a physiological function too.  </p>
<p>SebaSpace has been on a constant war with an anti-gay blogger also from Uganda and the war is always revolving around religion, culture and lifestyle. This created a stir in the LGBT blogosphere and another<a href=\"http://kenyangay.blogspot.com/\"> gay Kenyan blogger </a> wrotes a post<a href=\"http://kenyangay.blogspot.com/2009/05/response-to-rep-pepper.html \"> to answer the three questions </a><a href=\"http://www.redpepper.ug/\">The Red Pepper</a> had asked. The questions were:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. If you try to drink water through the ear, you naturally spoil it because it was created by God to do the hearing function. That&#39;s physical harm.</p>
<p>2. when they discovered you were gay. You know very well how we love having grandchildren in Africa. Imagine what goes on in your parents&#39; minds to know that you will never give them grandchildren (I am assuming that you a die-hard gay man but if you are bi, please forgive me). So that is emotional harm.</p>
<p>3. Spiritual harm. You tamper with God&#39;s plan of procreation. Understand that the main reason of creating the sexual organs was procreation purposes. For you in an attempt to be very creative, you put your organs at the disposal of pleasure only (I hope it is fun).If you have radical parents, they can start questioning God as to why he gave them such a child. I know parents of a gay boy who visited scores of witchdoctors thinking that their child had been bewitched. I can give you as many reasons as possible. I hope you are an objective gentleman who looks at things objectively.<br />
With so much hate from all sides, will the African Leaders put their priorities in order from all the pressure by the UN, IMF and World Bank and speak out for the sexual minorities or will still hold them in this invisible cage?
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href=\"http://kenyangay.blogspot.com/2009/05/response-to-rep-pepper.html\">His answers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ugandan rag called Red Pepper has been engaging Afro gay, a fellow Gay blogger from Uganda in arguments regarding the situation on Homosexuality in Uganda. Follow this link to see the full post. Recently, the editor of red pepper wrote to Afro arguing that he (Afro) was causing Physical, emotional and Spiritual harm to his family by being gay.</p>
<p>I promised Afro that I will write my responses to the Editor on my blog and link back with him. I have taken their questions, edited without altering the message and I have responded to each question.</p>
<p>I tend to disagree with you when you say that homos have never done anybody physical, emotional or spiritual harm.</p>
<p>Without any prejudice I want to tell you that they are guilty of all the three accounts.</p>
<p>Count 1. If you try to drink water through the ear, you naturally spoil it because it was created by God to do the hearing function. That&#39;s physical harm.</p>
<p>Red pepper has made three elementary mistakes (assumptions) 1) The common one that homosexuality is equal to sodomy (their shallow analogy of the ear above) 2) Following number 1 above that sodomy is practiced only by homosexuals and 3) That all homosexuals engage in anal sex.</p>
<p>I will deal with the last one first. Is the paper saying they are ok with someone with homosexual orientation as long as they don\x{2019}t engage in sex? Have they ever heard of celibate gay people and gay people who don\x{2019}t engage in anal sex? Well, I have and know both types.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting, that from the very beginning sodomy and homosexuality were two categorically separate things. The correct definition of sodomy&#8211;then and now&#8211;is simply non-procreative sex, whether practiced by heterosexuals or homosexuals. It includes oral sex, masturbation, mutual masturbation, contraceptive sex, coitus interruptus, and anal sex&#8211;any sex in which semen does not find its way into a uterus.</p>
<p>The anal sex thing is one elephant in the room, but it&#39;s not an inherent part of being gay, it isn&#39;t an activity engaged in exclusively by gay people.</p></blockquote>
<p>SebaSpace <a href=\"http://afrogay.blogspot.com/2009/05/questions-questions-red-pepper-persists.html\">refused to answer the questions</a> from Red Pepper. He gives reasons for his refusal: </p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the e-mail below, the editor of the Red Pepper has valid questions he is asking and, ordinarily, I would answer them \x{2013} indeed I have answered these questions over the years more times than I have had hot dinners.</p>
<p>The problem for me now is I don\x{2019}t believe the people asking the questions are sincere. Rightly or wrongly, I think all they are looking for is material to feed their tabloid frenzy and so I have refused to provide the answers. That said, I think it would be okay for other bloggers to attempt to answer them on their blogs or wherever as they are legitimate.</p>
<p>Here is the e-mail I got from the Red Pepper and the questions they posed [heavily emended for clarity]</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Well, you have not answered Phiona&#39;s question and I am sure she will maintain her opinion. I also have a feeling that you don&#39;t have an answer for it. The times I have interacted with you I have discovered that you are a clever man who cannot answer a question unless you are sure the answer is convincing.Again I tend to disagree with you when you say that homos have never done anybody physical, emotional or spiritual harm.<br />
Without any prejudice I want to tell you that they are guilty of all the three accounts.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While gay and lesbian bloggers in Africa use blogs to express themselves freely, there are also anti gay bloggers targeting them. One of them, Blake, had a blog called Kenyans Against Gays before it was suspended for violating Blogger&#39;s Terms of Service. <a href=\"http://kenyangay.blogspot.com/2009/02/anti-gay-blog-suspended.html\">Kenyan  Gay wrote about the suspension</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>A couple of years ago, a dude called Blake started this blog and I think the first thing he did was to announce its launch on my blog. Over time, that blog grew with articles explaining why he felt he should take a position against us etc.</p>
<p>However, from propagating his position against homosexuality in recent times he moved to actually calling for gay people in Kenya to be killed. I have been alerted by a reader that the blog has been suspended whilst being investigated for possible blogger rules violation. I suspect it is because of his latest position that was quite militant.</p>
<p>I am a believer in freedom of expression and actually think that blog helped expose that there are some willing to propagate hate to get their point across. But I draw the line when someone advocates for homosexuals to be killed.</p>
<p>I think his blog served us more than it aimed to destroy us. This is because we have many Kenyan gay blogs and Blake used to visit all of them and in the comments section try to drive traffic to his site. If you followed links, you would find that very many of the comments were from people who attempted to engage him intellectually on gay issues. Unfortunately, there were those usual vile comments from both sides with most insults coming from him. He was a troll on my blog until I decided to ignore him.</p></blockquote>
<p>When you visit Kenyans Against Gays blog <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogin.g?blogspotURL=http%3A%2F%2Fkenyansagainstgays.blogspot.com%2F\">you get the following message</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>
This blog is in violation of Blogger&#39;s Terms of Service and is open to authors only</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Blake went on to start<a href=\"http://www. kenyansagainstgays.wordpress.com/\"> another blog</a> using Wordpress. </p>

<p>Probabaly the most creative initiative to encourage people to vote is launched in Netherlands. <em>Kamran Ashtary</em>, Netherlands based blogger and artist, and his two friends Farhad Golyardi, editor of <a href=\"http://www.eutopia.nl\">Eutopia</a> and Shervin Nekuee, an Iranian sociologist, launched a site named<em> &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.voteforiran.com/\">Vote for Iran</a>.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Kamran <a href=\"http://www.voteforiran.com/2009/06/why-i-will-vote-kamran-ashtary/\">writes: </a></p>
<blockquote><p>I am voting with the hope that not only the hardline government will change, but that we will build a more democratic society where women\x{2019}s rights, a free press, free speech, and human rights are not a dream. Last 4 years proved our right can be in more danger than we could even imagine.</p>
<p>Being part of this initiative was unthinkable for me just four years ago. Four years of right-wing <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad\">Ahmadinejad</a> has put Iran on a downward path. I believe that Iranian expats should play a more constructive role and not keep waiting for some magical transformation of power.</p></blockquote>
<p>Iranians also in 25 different cities all over the world came together and announced they will vote:</p>

<p><em>Paicorg </em><a href=\"http://paicorg.wordpress.com/\">writes</a> [fa] that the election should be boycotted. The blog mentions that this election is not competitive and free.</p>

<blockquote><p>Current versions only support Windows; effective only when used in conjunction with Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, it has no effect when used with Firefox. The harmful information screened by the software includes politically-related harmful information, and the software relies on non-conventional methods to install, also ineffective within Firefox, closing the browser and adding the website address onto a banned list without confirmation. In Internet Explorer, the software&#39;s ability to classify clearly political content as &#8220;harmful information&#8221; is unreliable; for pornographic content, Green Dam is able to make relatively accurate assessments. When used with Firefox, however, the software shows no response.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Over blocking</strong></p>
<p>ESWN translated some teacher&#39;s <a href=http://www.zonaeuropa.com/200906a.brief.htm#017>comments on the filter software from KDnet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>- I don&#39;t want to discuss whether the functionalities of Green Dam are good or bad, but it is a nuisance because of all the upgrading that goes on.  We are a rural school, and we are using rural distance learning equipment (namely, Lenovo computers).  If we install Green Dam, then we cannot do simultaneous network broadcasts or hard disk protection.  Even if Green Dam guarantees safe Internet usage, how are we to maintain the software on our computers?  Our computer instructor is going to sit around all day to watch Green Dam being upgraded one computer at a time.  I am going to faint!  Our supervisory leaders must not know how to use computers!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>- Let me say something here.  We were ordered to install the software.  So I have to come to this website and curse.  After we installed the software, many normal websites are banned.  For example, it is normal for students to like games such as 4399, but not any more &#8230; many news reports have certain normal words but they are banned &#8230; for example, when <network News> reports that there is a campaign against pornographic websites, the software bans the story because the term &#8220;pornographic websites&#8221; was used.  Don&#39;t tell me how great the software technology is, because this is a piece of junk.  When we need to look up some course-related material, there is always some provocative advertisements on the pages so we can&#39;t access them anymore.  Why doesn&#39;t the state just ban those advertisements directly?  I want to curse someone out &#8230;</network></p></blockquote>
<p>As the keyword filter list includes words such as &#8220;touch&#8221; and &#8220;play&#8221; and the graphic detection is set to identify the proportion of skin color in a picture, funny results come out (also from ESWN&#39;s post):</p>
<blockquote><p>- Can I determine the content of the text filtering?  Today, a teacher posted an exam question which talks about &#8220;students playing touch-ball game.&#8221;  The Word document was shut down.  I spent a long time trying to determine the cause.  This was really depressing.  It will be a lot of work dealing these kinds of things in the future.</p>
<p>- How much flesh color does it take to make something &#8220;pornography&#8221;?  I went on the Internet to check out some animal photos.  A lovely little naked pig was sent onto the black list.  Pitiful little pig!  I was curious, so I looked up some photos of naked African women.  Oh, they were not censored!</p></blockquote>

<div class=\"translation\">The software is a scumbag equalizes homosexuality with obscenity and violence. Once it is installed, it would filter away all websites with homosexual content. Upon testing, all famous LGBT websites, such as <a href=http://www.aibai.cn>Aibai</a>, <a href=http://www.idanlan.com>idanian</a>, <a href=http://www.aifufu.com>aifufu</a> and etc would be inaccessible. We also found out that if the websites contain keywords such as homosexual, gay, lesbian, the software would automatically identify the graphics as having too many &#8220;skin color&#8221; and same sex intimacy. The websites would then be blocked, compiled in the black list and banned from future visit. </div>
<p><strong>Government budget and procedural justice</strong></p>
<p>Given all its flaws and not so reliable filter result, the question followed is why the MIIT would spend more than 41 million yuans to pay the software company, Jinhui Technologies, one year license fee? </p>

<div class=\"translation\">It is questionable whether the spending of the MIIT follows the principle of procedural justice. According to the report, even though it appears that the software is free, the cost is actually shouldered by the taxpayers as the MIIT and other departments will spend 41.7 million yuan for the one year license. As MIIT is very determined to continue the effort, the contract won&#39;t be ended after one year. Are we going to spend the huge amount of tax money on this in the future? Should such expense be properly budgeted and approved by people representatives?</p>
<p>Moreover, we also need to check if the administrative promotion of this particular software has violated the current anti monopoly law. </p></div>

<div class=\"translation\">People are more worried about its political implications. Beijing&#39;s control over the Internet is so obvious that everyone knows about its intension. Apart from building up the notorious Great Fire Wall in secret, it frequently launches campaign to clean up the Internet. A most well known example is the anti-vulgarity campaign. After the campaign, the Internet is still full of vulgar content, but a number of critical websites and bloggers have disappeared. It reflects Beijing&#39;s understanding of &#8220;vulgarity&#8221;. </p>
<p>Now it promotes via regulation a so-called pornography filter software. However, there isn&#39;t any independent third party to monitor the filtered content. And there isn&#39;t any discussion in the society about the policy. People would of course doubt if the Beijing&#39;s definition of pornography would include politics. It is likely that Beijing regards political pornography more damaging than bodily pornography. </p></div>

            'description' => "<p>News coming out of Pyongyang is not encouraging. After being accused of illegally crossing the border to North Korea, American Current TV journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/06/08/nkorea.journalists/index.html\">sentenced</a> to 12 years of hard labor (according to CNN).\x{a0} Jillian York <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/04/united-states-journalists-to-stand-trial-in-north-korea/?preview=true&amp;preview_id=78290&amp;preview_nonce=e6ca1b96c9\">rounded up blog posts</a> for Global Voices prior to the journalists&#39; sentencing.</p>
<p>The bleak outcome is eliciting strong reactions online from those who support freedom of press and want North Korea to release the two journalists. A <a href=\"http:/www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=60755553149&amp;ref=ts\">Facebook page for Laura and Euna</a> already has more than five thousand members. Today they are asking the public to respect the families privacy at this moment and not to get emotional:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You will have many emotions racing. Please try to stay clear of anger. Anger is a waste of energy and what North Korea wants of you.We can and will work together and use our minds, to work this through.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href=\"http://liberatelaura.wordpress.com/2009/06/08/something-rotten-in-pyongyang/\"><em>LiberateLaura</em></a>, a blog authored by Los Angeles entertainment journalist Richard Horgan, describes events happening in North Korea as &#8220;worthy of Shakespeare&#8221; and questions the decision of the &#8220;Hermit Kingdom&#8221; to arrest Laura Ling and Euna Lee:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Unfortunately, into that mad kingdom, just ahead of the chaos, wandered \@Current journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee. On Tuesday, March 17th, whether by accident or the trickery of a paid-off Chinese guide, they are alleged to have stepped across an invisible border line at a bridge crossing between China and North Korea. Harsh interrogations and two and a half months of solitary confinement followed, and now, after a brief trial, an absurd sentence of 12 years of hard labor for illegally crossing the border and an unspecified \x{201c}grave crime.\x{201d}</p>
<p>The Shakespearean analogy is useful because it allows us, just slightly, to make sense of the unfathomable June 8th Ling-Lee verdict. <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Kim Jong-il\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il\">Kim Jong-il</a> is indeed pushing it to the limit on the diplomatic, nuclear and innocent Americans fronts, all in a bid to reassure the country\x{2019}s military hard liners that a Kim Jong-un succession will maintain the Amy-first status quo.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>On <a href=\"http://youtube.com\">YouTube</a>, supporters are posting videos calling for the immediate release of Laura and Euna. There are also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s7DPyxKDPI\">videos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/90904665\@N00/3593573407\">photos</a> of vigils in South Korea, San Fransisco and elsewhere in the United States.</p>
<p>Here is as public service announcement from Pacific Rim Video and Kelly Hu:</p>
<div><object width=\"408\" height=\"248\" data=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rcakemWJ5FA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/rcakemWJ5FA&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /></object></div>
<p>As the public and various organizations promoting free press are coming together to call for Laura and Euna&#39;s release, some are now questioning the reactions of United States State Department and former U.S. vice president Al Gore (the founder and chairman of Current TV, which employed Euna and Laura) to the situation.</p>
<p>At <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/KF06Dg01.html\">Asia Times</a>, Donald Kirk says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The North Koreans also get offended every time a top-level American visitor visits the region, and one immediate complication of the trial is that it coincides with a trip to South Korea, China and Japan of a US delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg.</p>
<p>Steinberg has not talked publicly about the two women but has made clear in meetings with South Korea&#39;s President Lee Myung-bak and other top officials that the US is not willing to negotiate their fate. Could he have had their case in mind when he assured Lee that the US would not offer more aid for North Korea. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>He then proceeds to speculate about Al Gore&#39;s involvement in negotiations:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How about giving them up to a high-level American delegation? Gore comes to mind as the man for the job in view of his control over the network for which the two women were working.</p>
<p>Gore has been strangely silent throughout, all the more reason to think he&#39;s waiting to give face to the North Koreans and rescue the two women - a happy ending that may be too much to hope for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gore would be perfect for the mission. His presence would acknowledge North Korea&#39;s need for recognition as a member of the global nuclear club but would not constitute official US recognition of anything.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not everyone is taking Gore&#39;s silence so lightly.\x{a0} <em>John in Condition Yellow</em> takes Gore&#39;s lack of involvement less lightly, <a href=\"http://johninconditionyellow.blogspot.com/2009/06/wheres-al-gore.html\">saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#39;t expect Mr. Global Warming to just drop what he&#39;s doing and go sailing off to north Korea to negotiate the release of two people who work for him. The Nobel Peace Prize winner is far too busy saving the planet. Right? But how long would it take for him to issue a simple statement like, &#8220;Hey, Kim Jomg Il! Let my people go, or we will take your carbon credits away.&#8221;</p>
<p>But seriously, am I the only one who thinks that even a simple public statement from Mr. Pulitzer, condemning the trial, would at least be the decent thing to do for people who work for him?</p>
<p>Hmmm. Okay, maybe Bill Richardson would be more effective.</p></blockquote>
<p>But one thing is for certain, as <em>Jo </em><a href=\"http://jodiana.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/laura-ling-and-euna-lee-jailed-in-north-korea/\">points out</a> in the blog <em>Jo&#39;s Department</em> - everyone is wishing for the journalists&#39; safe return:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope that they do not endure Pyongyang\x{2019}s horrific (as described by escapees) prison system and that two journalists could safely return and be reunited to their families soon.</p></blockquote>

<p>At each of the <a href="http://www.gauravonomics.com/blog/the-4cs-social-media-framework/">four levels of Content, Collaboration, Community and Collective Intelligence</a>, social technologies can lead to both good and bad outcomes.</p>
<p>I have written before about <a href="http://www.gauravonomics.com/blog/shiv-senas-orkut-campaign-the-limits-to-freedom-of-expression-in-an-intolerant-india/">Shiv Sena&#39;s militant approach towards Orkut communities critical of the party, its leader Bal Thakeray, or its Hindutva ideology</a>. <a href="http://differentstrokes.blogspot.com/2006/09/caste-communities-on-orkut.html">Caste-based communities</a> on <a href="http://orkut.com">Orkut</a> are another disturbing example of online communities mirroring the dysfunctions in Indian society.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3621/3608655865_fe31b7290a.jpg?v=0" alt="Orkut Caste based Brahmin Community" width="420"/></div>
<p>For instance, there are more than 1000 <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?pno=1&amp;searchFor=C&amp;q=brahmin">communities for Brahmins on Orkut</a>. There are 461 Brahmin communities listed under <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?searchFor=C&amp;q=brahmin&amp;cid=10">culture and community</a>, 591 under <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?searchFor=C&amp;q=brahmin&amp;cid=23">religion and beliefs</a>, 87 under <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?searchFor=C&amp;q=brahmin&amp;cid=1">activities</a> and 117 under <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?searchFor=C&amp;q=brahmin&amp;cid=28">others</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most popular <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=5085362">Brahmin</a> community, with 28, 726 members, randomly claims: &#8220;we r clever &#038; hardworking. no one can fool us&#8230;&#8221; The <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=222887">Brahmans</a> community with 41952 members and the <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=386386">Brahmins of India</a> community with 30588 members are also very popular.</p>
<p>The other popular Brahmin communities are those for the various Brahmin sub-castes like <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=57061">Gawd Saraswat Brahmin (GSB)</a> (12,189 members), <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=4655806">Kokanastha Brahmin</a> (4038 members), <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=4924871">Deshashtha Brahmin</a> (4083 members), <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=16768078">Garhwali Brahmin</a> (3067 members), <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=13373956">Daivadnya Brahmin</a> (2654 members) and <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=17766387">Gaur Brahmin</a> (2055 members). Another group, <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=14790959">Brahmin Culture and Tradition</a> is &#8220;dedicated to the purpose of uniting Brahmins to revive, preserve, protect and propagate the Brahmin culture to descendants without intimidation or dilution from anti-Brahminical forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, it seems that most of the threads under <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?pno=1&amp;searchFor=F&amp;q=brahmin">topics related to Brahmins</a> have to do with defining the different types of Brahmins under various sub-castes.</p>
<p>There are also more than 1000 <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?pno=1&amp;searchFor=C&amp;q=yadav">communities for Yadavs on Orkut</a>, including gems like <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=23225502">modern yadav girls and boys</a> (5759 members).</p>
<p>Similarly, there are more than a 1000 <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?pno=1&amp;searchFor=C&amp;q=rajput">Rajput communities on Orkut</a>, including the <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#Community.aspx?cmm=10603460">Rajput the Royal Family</a> community with 35,481 mebers, which asks people to join the group &#8220;if your soul justifies that you are Rajput both by soul and by nature.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Main#UniversalSearch.aspx?searchFor=C&amp;q=dalit">Dalits</a> have about 200 mostly small communities on Orkut.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the low number of Dalit communities on Orkut says something about Indian society in general, and Orkut users in particular. Higher, more powerful, castes like Brahmins, Rajputs and Yadavs tend to have more money and easier access to the internet and old disparities are further accentuated by the internet.</p>
<p>Caste-based communities, however, aren&#39;t unique to Orkut.</p>

<p>There are dedicated websites for sub-castes as well. <a href="http://shakdwipi.com/">Sakhdwipi</a> aims &#8220;to provide a common forum for the Shakdwipis to know each other and interact with each other.&#8221; <a href="http://www.keralaiyers.com/">KeralaIyers</a> aims &#8220;to delve into the history, trace the roots, portray the life of modern day Kerala Iyers, and chronicle the achievements of this community.&#8221; <a href="http://www.ikalyanam.com/">iKalyanam</a> claims to be &#8220;the only exclusive site for Iyer matrimonials.&#8221; <a href="http://shivallibrahmins.com/">Shivalli Brahmins</a> wishes &#8220;to bring together all Shivalli Brahmins residing in different parts of the world, through meaningful discussions about their traditions.&#8221; <a href="http://www.gsbmatch.com">GSBMatch</a> is a matrimonial website for the Gowd and Saraswat Brahmin community. <a href="http://www.modhbrahmin.org/">ModhBrahmin.org</a> and <a href="http://www.brahmansamaj.org/">BrahmanSamaj.org</a> claim that &#8220;history proves that the people of Modh Brahmin Samaj are very enterprising and very resourceful&#8221; and aims to &#8220;bring all brothers and sisters of Samaj close.&#8221; <a href="http://www.jangidbrahminsamaj.com/">Jangid Brahmin Samaj</a> is a community for Jangid Brahmins. <a href="http://www.rsbnet.com/">RSBNet</a> is &#8220;a single stop source of information regarding the origin, customs, culture, history of Rajapur Saraswath Brahmins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, there are dedicated websites for other castes as well.</p>

<p>The Dalit community is fairly active on the internet, even though it&#39;s miniscule on Orkut. The <a href="http://www.idsn.org/">International Dalit Solidarity Network</a>, which has the most sophisticated of all these websites, &#8220;works on a global level for the elimination of caste discrimination.&#8221; <a href="http://www.dsnuk.org">Dalit Solidarity Network</a> &#8220;brings together organizations and individuals in the UK who are concerned with caste-based discrimination.&#8221; <a href="http://www.dalitindia.com/">Dalit India</a> has &#8220;papers on various specific issues of the Dalits of India living in India and abroad.&#8221; <a href="http://www.dalitnetwork.org">Dalit Freedom Network</a> &#8220;partners with the Dalits in their quest for religious freedom, social justice, and human rights by mobilizing human, informational, and financial resources.&#8221; <a href="http://www.dalitsolidarity.org">Dalit Solidarity</a> is &#8220;committed to the principles of justice and equality for all Indians, regardless of caste, race, gender or religion.&#8221; <a href="http://www.dalitvoice.org/">Dalit Voice</a> claims that India is &#8220;the original home of racism&#8221; as Dalits and Tribals, who &#8220;constitute the core of India&#39;s original inhabitants&#8221;, are kept enslaved by &#8220;alien Aryans&#8221;. <a href="http://www.daliteducation.org">Dalit Education</a> aims to &#8220;transform lives and communities through the Christian message.&#8221; <a href="http://www.dalitmuslims.com/">Indian Dalit Muslims Voice</a> is a platform to discuss issues concerning Indian Dalit Muslims. <a href="http://nms.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/8/2/187">Rohit Chopra</a> has written about the tension between the elite Hindu nationalists and the disadvantaged Dalits on the internet.</p>
<p>In terms of content, the majority of these websites are focused on matrimonial match-making, but several of them seek to build international communities based on caste affiliations and offer tools like directories, bulletin boards and forums to their members. I have also noticed a tendency to establish a rather embellished history of the caste, with detailed biographies of the important personalities belonging to the caste. <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/castes-gain-new-ground-on-the-net/389560/">Ashok Kumar at Express India</a> has a great description of the common features on these caste based websites.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Facebook has <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/s.php?init=q&amp;q=brahmin&amp;ref=ts&amp;sid=6f3718be87d1c75e997e55f0576872b3&amp;n=-1&amp;o=4&amp;k=200000010&amp;sf=t">only 46 small Brahmin groups</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/s.php?sid=6f3718be87d1c75e997e55f0576872b3&amp;init=q&amp;sf=r&amp;k=200000010&amp;n=-1&amp;q=yadav">60 small Yadav groups</a>,  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/s.php?sid=6f3718be87d1c75e997e55f0576872b3&amp;init=q&amp;sf=r&amp;k=200000010&amp;n=-1&amp;q=rajput">126 smal Rajput groups</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/s.php?sid=6f3718be87d1c75e997e55f0576872b3&amp;init=q&amp;sf=r&amp;k=200000010&amp;n=-1&amp;q=dalit">41 small Dalit groups</a>. The absence of caste based groups from Facebook is in line with its cosmopolitan user base.  Orkut, on the other hand, should be a little concerned about its tendency to attract loonies of all types.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the cosmopolitanism of Facebook is an anomaly, and Orkut&#39;s crude caste communities merely mirror India&#39;s splintered society.</p>

<p>Even before Obama&#39;s inauguration, and well before he decided which Middle Eastern or North African country he would choose to deliver his so called foreign policy speech in, some Moroccan-Americans lobbied for President Obama to come to Rabat. Some others suggested Casablanca. A website, <a id=\"qy-e\" title=\"President Obama to Speak in Morocco\" href=\"http://www.obamatospeakinmorocco.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>President Obama to Speak in Morocco</em></a>, was even set up for that purpose:</p>
<blockquote><p>[We invite] President Obama to make Morocco the home for his first foreign policy speech abroad.<br />
Morocco is the ideal country to launch a message of peace to the Muslim world.<br />
A peace loving country with a respected voice in the region, Morocco is a long time friend of the United States and would be proud to host President Barack Obama in this historical event.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eventually, and to the big disappointment of many Moroccan Obama enthusiasts, the American President did not speak in Morocco but preferred - logically, some would argue - Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/28/morocco-the-blogmas-journey-continues/\" target=\"_blank\">The blogoma</a> (acronym for Moroccan blogosphere) and many Moroccan <em>Twitter</em> users reacted differently to the Cairo <a id=\"crcu\" title=\"speech\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/04/AR2009060401117.html\" target=\"_blank\">speech</a>.

<p class=\"translation\" style=\"text-align: left;\">If I met Obama, I would ask him to dedicate some of his precious time to our leaders so he could erase their ignorance when treating their people and teach them some basics of democracy and how to get rid of this fear they have of their own people.</p>

<p><strong>Live-coverage</strong></p>
<p>One of the innovations made by the Obama administration was the possibility for members of the public to follow the Cairo speech through quotes sent by SMS text messages. The speech was a hot topic on Twitter where many live reactions were reported.</p>
<p><a id=\"ce1o\" title=\"Larbi_org\" href=\"http://www.larbi.org/post/2009/06/Joke\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Larbi_org</em></a> [Fr] followed the event and he twittered:</div>

<p>They were also some funny reactions <a href=\"http://twitter.com/annouss\" target=\"_blank\">when</a> \@annouss re-twitted \@mbaa&#8230;</div>

<blockquote><p>To all people inside Cairo university, Obama is not Husni Mubarak, you don&#39;t have to clap on each sentence.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p><em>Citoyen Hmida </em>has compared Cairo speech to the JFK&#39;s \x{ab}Ich bin ein Berliner\x{bb} speech. He <a id=\"dgq-\" title=\"stated\" href=\"http://www.citoyenhmida.org/obama-parle-aux-musulmans/\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> [Fr]:</p>
<blockquote><p>Le discours prononc\x{e9} \x{e0} l\x{2019}Universit\x{e9} du Caire a \x{e9}t\x{e9} ponctu\x{e9} par de nombreux applaudissements. En effet, le fait d\x{2019}entendre un pr\x{e9}sident am\x{e9}ricain dire \x{ab} Assalamou 3alienkoum \x{bb} peut redonner espoir. Cette formule rappelle le fameux \x{ab} Ich ben ein Berliner \x{bb} clam\x{e9} par J.F.K. lors de sa visite \x{e0} Berlin-Ouest en juin 1963.<br />
Obama a eu \x{e9}galement l\x{2019}\x{e9}l\x{e9}gance intellectuelle de citer, fort \x{e0} propos, certains versets du Coran.</p></blockquote>
<p class=\"translation\">The speech delivered at the University of Cairo was punctuated by much applause. The fact of hearing the American President saying \x{ab}Assalamou Alaykoum\x{bb} can give hope. This formula reminds the famous \x{ab} Ich ben ein Berliner \x{bb} stated by JFK when he visited Berlin in June 1963.<br />
Obama had also the intellectual elegance to quote certain verses of the Quran.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Citoyen Hmida</em> also <a href=\"http://www.citoyenhmida.org/obama-parle-aux-musulmans/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>(&#8230;)ce discours tant attendu n\x{2019}est en partie qu\x{2019}un tissu de lieux communs sur la civilisation arabo-musulmane et sur les positions am\x{e9}ricaines contre \x{ab} l\x{2019}extr\x{e9}misme violent \x{bb}.</p></blockquote>
<p class=\"translation\">This long awaited speech has been, in part, a string of platitudes about the Islamic-Arabic civilization and about the American condemnations of &#8220;violent extremism.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Abdoukili</em> reacts in a similar manner. He <a id=\"xz80\" title=\"wrote\" href=\"http://abdoukili.wordpress.com/2009/06/04/obamas-speech-to-the-muslim-world/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>The words Obama used like quotations from the Koran (to which he referred four times) and Islamic expression like \x{201c}assalaamu alaykum\x{201d} , \x{201c}azaan \x{201d} and \x{201c}Mohammed (peace be upon them) \x{201d} is a good public relation strategy to have more effect on the Muslim audience.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Wait and see</strong></p>
<p>Some other bloggers, even when they appreciated the Obama speech have adopted a \x{ab}wait and see\x{bb} position. <em>Laila Lalami</em>, a Moroccan author based in the US <a id=\"b_l-\" title=\"wrote\" href=\"http://lailalalami.com/2009/style-vs-substance/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a>:</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>One important test of this new approach, to my mind, is the settlements. Obama has already told Netanyahu that he wants a complete stop to Israeli settlements and that he won\x{2019}t accept \x{201c}natural growth\x{201d} exceptions. If he can do that, then this speech will be remembered as a turning point; if he can\x{2019}t, then it will go the way of all the speeches by the previous five administrations: nowhere.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p><strong>The Skeptic</strong></p>
<p>But not everybody was impressed by Obama&#39;s words. <em>Abdelhak al&#39;Koush</em>, blogging on <a id=\"vk2t\" title=\"Afinina\" href=\"http://afinina.maktoobblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Afinina</a> [Ar], launched a strong attack on the American president and questioned his motives in a discourteous post.

<div class=\"translation\">Obama came then to offer a kiss&#8230; &#8220;a kiss of death&#8221; to the already deceased Arab World[&#8230;]<br />
The bitter truth is, Obama is offering the United States the opportunity to take a breather after successive wars against the Arabs who are cold culturally, politically and religiously. After Obama, the American aggression will heighten.<br />
The American president succeeded in capturing the imagination of the Arabic herd (sic) including those Arab idiotic (sic) intellectuals, and then waved his hands mimicking our kings and titan despots in their distinct moments of hypocrisy; and the audience applauded warmly ending the first chapter of a comedy[&#8230;]</div>
<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>A Last Note of Hope</strong></p>

            'description' => "<p>The <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/06/05/peru-clashes-break-out-in-the-amazon-region/\">recent events in the Peruvian city of Bagua</a>, located in the jungle region have caused quite a reaction from the Peruvian blogosphere. Many are criticizing President Alan Garc\x{ed}a and his government for their failure to enforce treaties and agreements that require the consultation with local communities before any action take place on their lands. This led to the protests and roadblocks in this region, and as a result of the police&#39;s attempt to clear the blockade, it produced the conflict in which indigenous community members and police were killed.</p>
<p>There is also criticism of the way that the media is handling the situation, and opinions that many outlets are minimizing the deaths of the indigenous residents.</p>
<p>Silvio Rend\x{f3}n of <em>Gran Combo Club [es]</em> writes about the neglect from the government to enforce the regulations outlined by the Free Trade Agreement with the United States and the International Labor Organization, <a href=\"http://grancomboclub.com/2009/06/%C2%BFla-revolucion-amazonica-de-2009.html\">which stipulates that there must be consultation with indigenous communities in regards to the use of their lands</a>. He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>El tema no es la inversi\x{f3}n ni nacional ni extranjera, sino que se respeten los derechos de las comunidades nativas. Si el asunto arranca violando sus derechos, \x{bf}por qu\x{e9} las comunidades tendr\x{ed}an que creer que la violaci\x{f3}n de sus derechos no va a seguir?</p>
<p>El gobierno accedi\x{f3} al di\x{e1}logo en medio de la protesta nativa, con los bloqueos ya en marcha. Sin embargo, de repente el gobierno decide que no va a hacer nada si la medida de fuerza contin\x{fa}a. Un repentino cambio de reglas. Y adem\x{e1}s, \x{bf}qu\x{e9} puso sobre la mesa todo este tiempo? \x{bf}Consulta a los nativos? No. Modificaciones cosm\x{e9}ticas de las leyes rechazadas por los nativos. Entretanto, varios decretos han sido declarados inconstitucionales por la Defensor\x{ed}a del Pueblo como por la Comisi\x{f3}n de Constituci\x{f3}n del Congreso. No es que los nativos no tengan raz\x{f3}n. El gobierno viene forcejeando por leyes que han sido declaradas inconstitucionales.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">
<p>The issue is not about national or foreign investment, but that the rights of native communities are respected. If this continues to violate their rights, why should the communities believe that the violation of their rights will not continue?</p>
<p>The government agreed to dialogue amid native protests with the roadblocks already underway. However, the government suddenly decides that it will not do anything if the measures continue. A sudden change of rules. And besides, what did it place on the table during this entire time? Do you consult the natives? No, only cosmetic modifications of the laws rejected by the natives. Meanwhile, several decrees have been declared unconstitutional by the Ombudsman and by Constitutional Committee of Congress. It is not that the natives are not right.  The government continues to force laws that have been declared unconstitutional.</p>

<p>In his blog <em>Conflictos Sociales en el Per\x{fa} [es]</em>, Erick Garcia <a href=\"http://apuntesobreconflictos.blogspot.com/2009/06/desenlace-de-un-conflicto-la-muerte.html\">continues the criticism of the government for its role in this conflict</a> and its lack of prevention in this matter. Despite governmental intelligence and even common knowledge from reports from the media, it was well known that there were outside populations joining the protests:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ahora me pregunto si un par de Decretos Legislativos valen todo el odio y dolor que generar\x{e1}n estas muertes. Se podr\x{e1} ahora hablar de una soluci\x{f3}n pacifica y concertada con tantas muertes a cuestas (sobre todo cuando ya la Ministra del Interior ha declarado que Pizango y compa\x{f1}\x{ed}a deben ser detenidos y puestos a disposici\x{f3}n de las autoridades \x{2013} RPP 16:30) Lamentablemente comenzar\x{e1} la caser\x{ed}a por encontrar a los responsables \x{201c}pol\x{ed}ticos\x{201d} e \x{201c}ideol\x{f3}gicos\x{201d} de esta masacre; qu\x{e9} actitud que tomar\x{e1} el parlamento respecto a los decretos a\x{fa}n es incierto (seguramente estar\x{e1}n pensando m\x{e1}s en la censura ministerial que en otra cosa); lo \x{fa}nico claro es que el tema de fondo que en alg\x{fa}n momento pudo discutirse \x{201c}el modelo de desarrollo amaz\x{f3}nico\x{201d} solo sabe Dios cuando volver\x{e1} al debate p\x{fa}blico.</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">Now I wonder if a few legislative decrees are worth all the hatred and pain that have caused these deaths. We could now talk about a peaceful and agreed upon resolution at the cost of so many deaths (especially when the Minister of Interior has stated that (indigenous protest leader) Pizango and others should be arrested and brought to the authorities - 16:30 RPP) Unfortunately, the hunt will begin to find those &#8220;political&#8221; and &#8220;ideological&#8221; individuals responsible for the massacre; what position will the parliament take on the decrees is still unclear (surely they are thinking more about ministerial censure, than anything else), the only thing clear is that main issue that could have been discussed &#8220;the model for Amazon development&#8221; only God knows when it can return to public debate.</div>
<p>Peruvian ex-pat in Spain, Jomra <a href=\"http://bitacora.jomra.es/2009/06/peru/alan-garcia-miente-selva/\">unequivocally criticizes President Garc\x{ed}a [es]</a>, who <a href=\"http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20090605/37781/Presidente-Alan-Garcia-advierte-a-nativos-Ya-esta-bueno-de-protestas\">said [es]</a> that the protesters were wrong and that they cannot tell 28 million of Peruvians that they are not welcome in that region and by doing so they are stepping into irrationality and &#8220;primitive retreat.&#8221;  Jomra writes about Garc\x{ed}a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No solo es mentiroso, sino que es intolerante e ignorante de la propia Constituci\x{f3}n y los tratados que Per\x{fa} ha firmado. &#8230; Pero lo importante es el fondo: El presidente asume que puede aplastar lo que la Constituci\x{f3}n y el Convenio OIT n\x{ba} 169 Sobre Pueblos Ind\x{ed}genas y Tribales en Pa\x{ed}ses Independientes (de 1989, entr\x{f3} en vigor en el 91 y Per\x{fa} lo ratific\x{f3} en el 94), en la primera se establece una entidad jur\x{ed}dica especial para las Comunidades nativas y campesinas que el ejecutivo debe respetar y en el segundo se obliga a que toda decisi\x{f3}n que afecte a las comunidades sea previamente consultada. El DL 1090 no lo ha sido.</p>
<p>Garc\x{ed}a cada vez que puede acusa a la dirigencia de las comunidades de manipular a los pobres ignorantes, a la vez que pone que todo esto est\x{e1} orquestado por otros pa\x{ed}ses, no se atreve a acusar a Venezuela pero indica que a quien conviene es a Chile (supongo que en el vecino del sur se mueren de risa al o\x{ed}r los desprop\x{f3}sitos de Garc\x{ed}a).</p>
</blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">
<p>Not only is he a liar, but he is intolerant and ignorant of the Constitution and treaties which Peru has signed. &#8230; But the most important thing is: The president assumes that he can discard what is outlined by the Constitution and ILO Agreement No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989, entered into effect in 1991 and ratified by Peru in 1994). The first establishes a special legal entity for the indigenous and peasant communities and farmers, and that the executive branch must respect this entity. The second requires that any decision affecting the community must be in consultation. Decree 1090 was not in consultation.</p>
<p>Whenever Garc\x{ed}a can accuse the community leaders of manipulating the poor and ignorant, he does. At the same time, he says that this is orchestrated by other countries, he does not dare to accuse Venezuela, but he said that this benefits Chile ( I suppose that in the southern neighbor is dying of laughter when they heard this nonsense from Garc\x{ed}a).</p>

<p>Amazilia Fracaso of <em>Per\x{fa} Apartheid [es]</em> <a href=\"http://amazilia.wordpress.com/2009/06/06/fracaso-peruano/\">writes about the failure of Peruvian society</a> and one of those symptoms is that the deaths could have been avoided. She also criticizes the media for their role during this crisis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tambi\x{e9}n lo es que la indiferencia e incluso la justificaci\x{f3}n de muchos comentaristas y bloggers, que haya gente que es capaz de aceptar estas muertes como necesarias para mantener el orden y el desarrollo significa que a\x{fa}n estamos muy lejos de ser un pa\x{ed}s que pueda caminar hacia adelante.</p>
<p>Es vegonzoso como los medios de comunicaci\x{f3}n como Peru21, El Comercio, RPP, desinforman a la poblaci\x{f3}n y se dedican a poner a la opini\x{f3}n p\x{fa}blica en contra de las protestas sociales, ya sea minimizando las muertes que los nativos han sufrido, escondiendo informaci\x{f3}n o exagerando y dandole un spin t\x{e9}trico a las noticias. Esto tambi\x{e9}n pasa con alguna prensa internacional, Sim\x{f3}n Romero del NYT hace una nota sobre la protesta, mezcla el conflicto con Sendero Luminoso, (y) presenta a los nativos como anti-desarrollo.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">
<p>It is also the indifference and even the justification from many commentators and bloggers, who are people that are able to accept these deaths as necessary to maintain order and development, that means that we are still far from being a country that can move forward.</p>
<p>It is shameful that media such as Peru21, El Comercio, RPP, misinform the public and devote themselves to sway public opinion against the social protests, either by minimizing the deaths that the natives have suffered, hiding information or by exaggerating and giving a grim spin on the news. This also happens with some international press, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/world/americas/06peru.html?_r=1&#038;ref=global-home\">Simon Romero of the New York Times</a> writes an article about the protest, but mixes the conflict with the Shining Path, (and) presents the natives as anti-development.</p>

The number of attendees has broken the record since 1990, telling the world that Hong Kong people have not given up the demand for vindication of June 4th. However, more than half of the local newspapers and the most viewed TV station decided to downplay the news.</p>
<p>ESWN <a href=\"http://www.zonaeuropa.com/200906a.brief.htm\">collected the front page of local newspapers on June 5</a>. Among the 13 Chinese newspapers, only 4 had placed the candle night vigil on the frontpage. Headline News and Sing Pao put the passing away of a local actor Sek Kin on the front page; Hong Kong Commerical Press and Hong Kong Economic Journal put up the interview of the future-to-be CEO of Hong Kong stock exchange; Sing Tao, Hong Kong Daily News, Oriental Daily and the Sun highlight stories on youth&#39;s deviant behavior - drug abuse and sex work. Wen Wei Po stressed Chinese government&#39;s favorable polices to Hong Kong. Below are the images of the 4 cover stories (via ESWN):</p>

<p>Apart from printed papers, T.V company&#39;s self-censorship have more pervasive effect in Hong Kong as television broadcasting sector is highlight monopolized because of the government&#39;s license policy. There are currently only 2 over-the-air commercial television station in Hong Kong, TVB and ATV, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVB\">the Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) alone</a>, has taken up 80% of viewership. In recent year, there are more and more criticisms saying that the TVB&#39;s news department has been harmonized (adopting self-censorship).</p>
<p>On June 4, the TVB Jade (Chinese) channel placed the candle night vigil in the third news item and outraged many people. A citizen took action to protest against the TV news department by holding a slogan in front of the camera when the reporter was having live report. Here is the youtube record:</p>

<div class=\"translation\">Yesterday the most discussed topic was probably not how many people had attended the June 4 candle night vigil, not Richard Lee&#39;s private life, but the protest banner of &#8220;TVB news, a sloppy production&#8221; shown during the CCTVB&#39;s live broadcast. My friend A told me that the CCTVB news department leader Yuen Chi Wai was very angry about the incident. But as my friend A said, we could not complain about the heavenly disaster but this is a man-made choice. It is so obvious even to ordinary people that Yuen Chi Wai had downplayed the release of Zhao Ziyang memoirs. On June 4, CCTVB even placed the news to the third news session. How can anyone defend for what it had done?</div>

<div class=\"translation\">On June 4, the headline of CCTVB in 6:30pm is &#8220;three boy fainted in a Tinshiuwai park due to drug abuse&#8221;. Well, this can still be considered a piece of news. However, the second item is &#8220;Legco has passed the motion to construct Hong Kong island western subway line&#8221;. That motion was only passed by a discussion group on railway affair of the transportation committee of the Legislative Council. It isn&#39;t any railway affair committee in the Legco, the report is misleading in the first place. The so-called committee is just a discussion group within the transportation affair committee. What is the significance of such news? Usually CCTVB won&#39;t even report on standard committee&#39;s meeting, why then decided to put the discussion group&#39;s decision before the June 4 candle night vigil where 150,000 people had attended?</div>
<p>Netizens started making fun of TVB by calling it CCTVB, a sister company of its China counterpart CCTV. In the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=83303283333\">facebook</a>, a group was formed to protest against CCTVB and netizens have designed new logos for it:</p>

French newspaper Le Point <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-politique/2009-06-07/au-pouvoir-depuis-41-ans-le-president-gabonais-omar-bongo-est-mort/917/0/350399\">reported</a> that they received news of his death, by cancer, in a private clinic in Barcelona, through a &#8220;source close to the President&#39;s entourage&#8221;. AFP, on the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gmh-vG8pht1d7rLFZ0CaiagGuLNw\">reported</a> a French governmental source. But later Prime Minister Jean Eyeghe Ndong told Gabonese TV that he had been &#8220;<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8088382.stm\">very surprised</a>&#8221; to read the reports.</p>

<p>When Omar Bongo was admitted in Barcelona&#39;s Quir\x{f3}n clinic earlier in May, a comment by Akin a the <em>African Loft</em> <a href=\"http://www.africanloft.com/omar-bongo-is-the-end-near-for-africas-longest-serving-tyrant/#comment-42737\">predicted</a> his death away from his subjects:</p>
<blockquote><p>The greatest indictment of his lamentable regime of 42 years is that Gabon does not have hospitals that could treat either himself or his wife.</p>
<p>What kind of leadership is one that cannot bring any appreciable benefits to its people whilst the leaders jet off to foreign lands for the slightest sign of discomfort?</p>
<p>This is an indictment that applies to probably the whole of African leadership, the inability to raise the standards of infrastructure, education, health and opportunity.</p>
<p>When would we be able to make all leadership really accountable for their years of disservice?</p>
<p>[&#8230;] The morale of this sordid tale is unAfrican in its context, the king shall not die in his palace surrounded by his subjects who \x{201c}adore\x{201d} him but in a non-descript expensive hospital room surrounded by strangers.</p>
<p>A king that fails to rule with probity will die in a distance in disgrace with everyone breathing a long sigh of relief - Good riddance! To them all.</p></blockquote>

<div class=\"translation\">Friend of all French governments since De Gaulle, Albert-Bernard Bongo, who later became El Hadj Omar Bongo and then Ondimba (the people were asking for democratic change, he offered them personal name changes), he never stopped being the French secret service agent that he had been since he came to power. With his longevity and fortune amassed in power, the Hadj afforded himself the luxury of financing electoral campaigns in France, in particular that of Fran\x{e7}ois Mitterrant as written by Pierre P\x{e9}an in &#8220;African Affairs&#8221;. He&#39;s also leaving gigantic real estate assets and private property in France, and secret bank accounts that are making the tax havens where they are hosted very happy. Meanwhile, the Gabonese people are lacking everything. With this legacy, he will not be missed at all. And the Africans that he was cynically pretending to represent will not mourn him either.</div>
<p>Citing Togo&#39;s experience, Kopgli doubts Bongo&#39;s death will bring change:</p>
<blockquote><p>La mort de Bongo n\x{2019}apportera rien de salutaire au peuple gabonais, car les h\x{e9}ritiers Ali et Pascaline Bongo sont d\x{e9}j\x{e0} positionn\x{e9}s et port\x{e9}s par Bollor\x{e9} \x{2013} ami personnel de Sarkozy \x{2013} et de Christophe de Margerie de TotalFinaElf et de bien d\x{2019}autres vampires pour capter le pouvoir, comme ce fut le cas du Togo o\x{f9} les fils du d\x{e9}funt Gnassingbe ont \x{e9}t\x{e9} port\x{e9}s au pouvoir sous le double poids du viol et des violences.</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">Bongo&#39;s death is not going to bring anything beneficial to the Gabonese people, because the heir and heiress Ali and Pascaline Bongo have already been groomed and brought by Bollor\x{e9} -personal friend of Sarkozy- and of Christophe de Margerie of TotalFinaElf and many other vampires to suck power, as it was the case in Togo where the children of the late Gnassingbe were brought to power under the double weight of rape and violence.</div>
<p>Ivorian blogger Th\x{e9}ophile Kouamouo [Fr], who also mentions Togo, ponders about what will happen after Bongo&#39;s death and <a href=\"http://kouamouo.ivoire-blog.com/archive/2009/06/08/omar-bongo-la-fin-d-un-dinosaure.html\">wonders about the future of the Fran\x{e7}afrique</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maintenant que le &#8220;patriarche&#8221; n&#39;est plus, l&#39;on entre dans l&#39;\x{e8}re des incertitudes et des questionnements. Le sch\x{e9}ma constitutionnel - remise du pouvoir \x{e0} la pr\x{e9}sidente du S\x{e9}nat puis \x{e9}lections - sera-t-il respect\x{e9} ? Va-t-on vers un sch\x{e9}ma de bataille fratricide \x{e0} la togolaise [&#8230;]? L&#39;arm\x{e9}e gabonaise, totalement invisible, entrera-t-elle en sc\x{e8}ne ?</p>
<p>Puis profond\x{e9}ment, quel est le bilan d&#39;Omar Bongo Ondimba ? Apr\x{e8}s sa mort, la Fran\x{e7}afrique, dont il \x{e9}tait le pilier, s&#39;affaiblira-t-elle ? Pour ma part, je pense que oui - mais peut-\x{ea}tre que je m&#39;avance trop. Ce syst\x{e8}me-l\x{e0} \x{e9}tait trop centr\x{e9} sur un certain nombre d&#39;hommes, de petits secrets, de r\x{e8}gles de d\x{e9}part qui n&#39;existent plus, pour perdurer \x{e9}ternellement.[&#8230;]</p>
<p>La Fran\x{e7}afrique s&#39;affaiblira, mais la d\x{e9}mocratie avancera-t-elle ? L&#39;Afrique se retrouvera bient\x{f4}t face \x{e0} son destin et aux contradictions de son Histoire. Personne ne l&#39;aidera \x{e0} en d\x{e9}m\x{ea}ler les noeuds. Mais observons d&#39;abord ce qui se passera dans les prochains jours au Gabon.</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">Now that the &#8220;patriarch&#8221; has passed away, we are entering an era of uncertainty and questioning. The constitutional outline -power transfer to the President of the Senate and then elections-, is it going to be respected? Are we going to fall into fratricidal fighting like in Togo [&#8230;]? Is the Gabonese army, completely invisible, going to enter the scene?</p>
<p>More profoundly, what is the legacy of Omar Bongo Odinma? After his death, is the Fran\x{e7}afrique, of which he was the pillar, going to weaken? Personally, I think so - but maybe I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. This system was too focused on certain men, on little secrets, on exit rules that don&#39;t exist anymore, to last forever. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Fran\x{e7}afrique will grow weaker, but will democracy move forward? Africa will soon be faced to its own destiny and to the contradictions of its history. Nobody will help her to untie the knots. But let&#39;s first observe what will happen in the next days in Gabon.</p></div>
<p>Emmanuel Bellart of Cameroon [Fr] <a href=\"http://atelier.rfi.fr/forum/topics/il-est-mort-le-doyen-de-la\">expressed</a> his relief:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dieu merci, car un autre est parti, l&#39;afrique commence \x{e0} respirer petit \x{e0} petit, il ne fallait plus que \x{e7}a pour que l&#39;afrique puisse finalement ouvrir les yeux, monsieur omar bongo qui a mit 41 ans au pouvoir, ce qui est iraisonnable nous a montr\x{e9} combien ces vieux de la france voulaient vraiment detruire l&#39;afrique, c&#39;est claire que personne ne doit souhaiter la mort d&#39;un \x{ea}tre humain, mais d&#39;un c\x{f4}t\x{e9}, c&#39;est un soulagement pour le peuple gabonais, sauf qu&#39;il y&#39;avait une chose que monsieur bongo devait faire, c&#39;est organiser le pouvoir et non de le preparer pour ses enfants [&#8230;]</p>
<p>adieu le doyen, laissons le pouvoir au peuple et non \x{e0} une personne, quand tu t&#39;accapare du pouvoir , tu meurs et on t&#39;oublit</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">Thank God, another one is gone and Africa is starting to breathe little by little. That&#39;s all we needed for Africa to be able to open her eyes at last. Mr Omar Bongo spent 41 years in power, which is unreasonable, he showed us how much those old Frenchmen really wanted to destroy Africa. It&#39;s obvious that nobody wishes the death of another human being, but on the other hand it&#39;s a relief for the Gabonese people, except that there was something that mister Bongo needed to do and it was organize power instead of grooming his children [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Goodbye the most senior [dictator], let&#39;s leave the power to the people and not to one person, when you monopolize all power you die and we forget you</p></div>
<p>At the newsportal Gaboneco [Fr], a Gabonese reader named Ogwera <a href=\"http://gaboneco.com/editcomment.php?article=13825\">left a comment</a> asking for democratic elections:</p>
<blockquote><p>Je suis un citoyen gabonais et j&#39;exige des \x{e9}lections dans le strict respect de la constitution de La R\x{e9}publique!!!! et je dis non \x{e0} ceux qui appelle la france \x{e0} se m\x{ea}ler de la politique gabonaise notamment BEN MOUMBAMBA qu&#39;on ne connait pas et qui pourrait \x{ea}tre un pion de cette france! Les gabonais doivent s&#39;unir et rester vigilants!</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">I&#39;m a Gabonese citizen and I&#39;m demanding elections in the uttermost respect of the constitution of the Republic!!! and I&#39;m saying no to those that are calling for France to meddle in Gabonese politics, in particular Ben Mouamba whom we don&#39;t know and who could be a pawn of France! Gabonese must unite and remain vigilant!</div>

Air France flight number <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447\">AF 447</a> took off from Brazil on Sunday 31th of May with 216 passengers and 12 crew members and was expected to arrive at its destination the next day. It never arrived.</p>

<p>Authorities say 58 Brazilians were killed in the crash. But on some Brazilian blogs, the debate is about the media coverage of the disaster. For <em><a href=\"http://leitedecobra.blogspot.com/2009/06/voo-447.html \">Leite de Cobra</a></em> [pt], the way in which the non-arrival of the airbus and supposed disaster has been treated is outrageous:</p>
<blockquote><p>Acho perverso isso da imprensa ficar divulgando fatos e particulares da vida das v\x{ed}timas do desastre a\x{e9}reo. N\x{e3}o t\x{ea}m o m\x{ed}nimo respeito e nem disfar\x{e7}am o desejo de que a dor renda, em escala nacional, o m\x{e1}ximo poss\x{ed}vel, at\x{e9} que venha a pr\x{f3}xima cat\x{e1}strofe, o pr\x{f3}ximo esc\x{e2}ndalo. \x{d4} corja! Por isso que n\x{e3}o acompanho mais nada desse triste epis\x{f3}dio. Pra mim deu</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">I think the media is perverse when releasing news and private information about the disaster victims&#39; lives. They don\x{2019}t have the least respect for the victims and they don\x{2019}t even conceal their desire that the pain lasts, in national proportions, as long as possible, until the next catastrophe, the next scandal, arrives. Oh vultures! That\x{2019}s why I won\x{2019}t follow anything else about this case. I&#39;ve had enough!</div>
<p>According to bloggers, the problem is that the media always wants to report something and prove it right, come what may -  creating theories and enhancing sensationalism. <em>Camerini</em>, from blog <em><a href=\"http://transbrasil.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/voo-447-pode-ter-tido-problemas-em-zona-intertropical/\">Transbrasil</a></em> [pt], states:</p>

<p>\x{c9} prematuro qualquer indica\x{e7}\x{e3}o sobre o acidente at\x{e9} que as equipes consigam, primeiro localizar os destro\x{e7}os do avi\x{e3}o, depois a Caixa Preta, com o Data Recorder e o Voice Recorder, mas, como d\x{e1} audi\x{ea}ncia levar para a Tv um bando de especialistas natos em acidentes a\x{e9}reos, o que se pode fazer!</p>
<p>Ouvir um Chamar o avi\x{e3}o da Air France de Boeing A 330, outro dizer que o Atl\x{e2}ntico \x{e9} o lugar mais seguro do sistema solar , depois outro que afirma categoricamente que um raio derrubou o avi\x{e3}o!</p>
<p>A Verdade \x{e9} que ningu\x{e9}m sabe ainda o que aconteceu, aonde aconteceu e como aconteceu, mas muitos especialistas deveriam saber que um acidente a\x{e9}reo n\x{e3}o ocorre apenas por uma s\x{f3} causa, e sim por mais fatores que desencadeam um acidente</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">The round the clock experts have already been talking a lot of rubbish on TV.</p>
<p>They have talked and talked about things that are just speculation. Even lightning has been blamed for the Air France plane crashing!</p>
<p>It\x{2019}s too early to indicate anything about the accident until the rescue groups can first find the aircraft debris, and the black-box, with the data and voice recorders. But as bringing a bunch of naturally-born-specialists to TV attracts a large audience, what can be done!</p>
<p>I have heard one of them calling the Air France aircraft a Boeing A330, another one saying that the Atlantic Ocean is the safest place in the solar system, and then, another one emphatically affirming that lightning knocked the aircraft down!</p>
<p>The truth is that nobody knows what has happened, where it has happened and how it has happened, but many specialists should know that an air accident doesn\x{2019}t happen for just one reason, but because of a series of factors which cause an accident.</p></div>
<p>For <em><a href=\"http://shimarina.blogspot.com/2009/06/sobre-as-teorias-que-surgem-agora.html\">Eu, Voc\x{ea} e Todo Mundo</a></em> [pt], the desperate search for specialists is also a problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gente, que absurdo!</p>
<p>Eu como jornalista fico indignada mesmooo!!!

<div class=\"translation\">Guys, how absurd! As a journalist myself, I do indeed feel outraged!!! Here on the <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-166186655.html\">Futura channel</a> we have received an e-mail from a PR office located in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campinas\">Campinas</a>, in which a holistic therapist analyzed this catastrophe using numerology and taro. Anyway, according to that press release, the catastrophe is the result of a conjunction of factors such as bad numbers, bad feelings\x{2026} I think it is just too much to explore such a tragedy in this way. What a shame\x{2026}. Also shame on the journalists, who publish it! See absurd: I\x{2019}m not judging the numerologist, but the way she has been used in this case.</div>
<p>With a very controversial comment which raises the much discussed issue that <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/11/brazil-when-climate-change-meets-cyber-activism/\">some disasters are considered more important</a> and newsworthy than others according to the social class of those involved, <em><a href=\"http://psysapiens.posterous.com/voo-447-nada-de-novo-so-mais-do-mesmo\">Bruno Nepumoceno</a></em> [pt] reached the following conclusion, after talking to people at work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fui dar minha opini\x{e3}o sobre o assunto e nego ficou me criticando, dizendo que eu n\x{e3}o tenho cora\x{e7}\x{e3}o, que eu sou insens\x{ed}vel e coisas do tipo. A vontade que deu e de dizer: VOC\x{ca}S QUE S\x{c3}O BURROS OS SUFICIENTE PARA N\x{c3}O ENXERGAR QUE O JORNALISMO GANHA DINHEIRO EXPLORANDO A DESGRA\x{c7}A ALHEIA!

Centenas morrem de fome no nordeste Brasileiro. O que \x{e9} um avi\x{e3}ozinho cair?</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">I spoke my mind about the subject and the guys criticized me, saying that I am heartless, that I have no feelings for such news as this. In fact, what I wanted to say is the following: YOU ALL ARE STUPID ENOUGH NOT TO REALISE THAT THE MEDIA MAKES MONEY BY EXPLOITING OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S MISFORTUNE! If it was a bus full of people from northeast [of Brazil], the case would have been forgotten.\x{a0}Thousands of people die of hunger on the African Continent. Hundreds die of hunger in the Brazilian Northeast. What is the big deal with a little aircraft crashing?</div>

<p>Nevertheless, there is an intense wave of grief and shock around the world, and naturally Brazilian bloggers are not the only ones discussing the accident online. From Kuwait, the blogger <em><a href=\"http://www.zdistrict.com/2009/06/02/air-france-447-tragedy/\">ZDistrict</a></em> summed up his feelings.</p>
<blockquote><p>228 people from Brazil to France on an Air France flight has vanished over the Atlantic after flying into turbulence. I haven\x{2019}t seen a tragedy such as this in a long time, a flight of this type crashing in the middle of the Atlantic.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href=\"http://www.zdistrict.com/2009/06/02/air-france-447-tragedy/#comment-233389\">Charles</a></em>, a commenter on ZDistrict has this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fear, helpless, horrific moment - it brings tears and heart ache to hear anyone enduring that final moment. Really hope they were all asleep during all that moments. Its over now, their faith bring them to where they belong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenter <em><a href=\"http://www.zdistrict.com/2009/06/02/air-france-447-tragedy/#comment-233367\">Another Me</a></em> states:</p>
<blockquote><p>i\x{2019}m so sad for the families. i fly frequently and can\x{2019}t imagine what the passengers must have felt, not to mention the families. i also have an infant and that just breaks my heart to think of that innocent little baby, unaware of what\x{2019}s happening. in my opinion, the governing international aviation athority (whoever that is) needs to restrict pilots from flying through or above thunderstorms, and require that they fly around all storms. those storms can reach upward of 50,000 ft; trying to fly above is just too risky.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many times, air tragedies occurring over the Atlantic Ocean have been associated with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle\">Bermuda Triangle</a>, which is located north of Brazil, between Florida (USA), Puerto Rico and Bermuda. Still from Kuwait, Twitter user <em>\@<a href=\"http://twitter.com/2twentythree3/statuses/1995737255\x{201d}\">2Twenty3 </a></em>suggests that the &#8220;Bermuda triangle needs investigating&#8221;.<a href=\"http://twitter.com/2twentythree3/statuses/1995737255\x{201d}\"><br />
</a></p>
<p>Cynthia Drescher, blogging at the <em>Britannica Blog</em>, <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2009/06/is-air-france-flight-447-lost-in-the-bermuda-triangle/\x{201d}\">says</a> that the lack of information regarding the disaster will bring out conspiracy theorists, and many have alredy tried to link the crash with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle\">Bermuda Triangle</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>\x{2026}[T]he skeptics would like to heighten the drama by associating the Bermuda Triangle with this recent mystery. What\x{2019}s next \x{2014} asserting that the Triangle is now some sort of giant trapezoid? Perhaps the mysterious area got bored with hanging out off the US coast and decided to journey to Brazil for some caipirinhas?<br />
Although authorities haven\x{2019}t yet confirmed that the floating seats are indeed from the missing Air France jet, it\x{2019}s pretty easy to see on the map above that for once, this possible tragedy has nothing to do with aliens or electromagnetic fields or the ghost of Amelia Earhart. It does, however, have everything to do with freak accidents and airplane safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not forgetting the Bermuda Triangle effect, Polish blog <a href=\"http://tierraincognita.blox.pl/2009/06/Katastrofa-Air-France.html\"><em>Tierra Incognita</em> </a>[pl], wonders what has happened, affirming that despite the\x{a0} catastrophe of the disappearance, he stills loves flying:</p>

<div class=\"translation\"><strong>I love flying on air planes</strong>.  The air travel is not stressful to me at all, on the contrary - it relaxes me and calms me down. The moment the machine stops touching earth I get into a specific state of peacefulness, I have a feeling that all my problems and troubles are left below. The thought of being stuck for the next few hours in a completely different dimention where nothing really depends on me, is really cool. Like a kid, I can stare through the window for hours, even if its nighttime and all I can see is stars. I wonder why exactly this accident touched me so deeply? Probably there are a few reasons - Air France is one of my favourite companies, just a few days ago I walked my close friend for a flight from Caracas to Paris, and I myself very often travel on the line South America - Europe. And the whole  mystery surrounding this catastrophe \x{2013} not the &#8216;usual&#39; problems with take off or landing, but disappearance somewhere in the middle of the ocean. Good job it didn&#39;t happen over the Bermuda Triangle&#8230; Luckily I do not think that this accident will change my attitude towards flying. I am still happy that I will most probably have to sit\x{a0} on a plane a few times this month. And I hope that this month too I will be able to catch the plane to the Moon.</div>
<p>Discussions and rumours have begun to focus not only on the strange weather patterns in the part of the Atlantic where the plane went down, but also on the computer systems on the Airbus A330-203. Specifically, some are investigating the coincidences between the Air France flight and an October 2008 Quantas flight headed for Perth, Australia that dropped 200 meters in a matter of minutes, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing.

<blockquote><p>It has been reported by The Aviation Herald, an online Europe based journal of aviation incidents and news that the main body of electronic alerts begin with the disengagement of the autopilot and were followed by messages related to the ADIRU or air data and inertial reference units and the PRIM or flight control primary computer which is informed about speed, attitude and other material flight values by the ADIRUs.<br />
Superficially this resembles the onset of the mid air upset that caused Qantas flight QF72 from Singapore to Perth to make an emergency landing in Learmonth last October.<br />
The PRIM will in some flight modes intervene in the flight controls settings of the jet to inhibit pilot inputs which would exceed critical limits which could stall the airliner, or overload parts of the structure or control surfaces on the wings or rudder.<br />
However these limitations can also be in turn locked out by the pilot.<br />
Other reports indicate that these \x{2018}unprecedented\x{2019} messages were concentrated in a four minute period, ending with a final advisory message about the vertical speed, that is, the rate at which the jet was falling rather than any speed with which it was also moving forwards.<br />
Faulty ADIRU units in the Qantas A330-300 operating the flight that diverted to Learmonth remain a major focus of an unfinished air accident investigation by the ATSB. That investigation is also looking at other ADIRU related incidents on Qantas A330s.<br />
However the Qantas ADIRU units were made by Northrop Grumman, while those in the Air France jet were made by Honeywell, They are two completely different designs, running totally different sets of programmed logic to serve the same ends.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the passengers whose lives were claimed by the crash were French: there were 61 French passengers and 11 French crewmembers. Charles-guy de Kerimel, the writer of the aviation history blog <a href=\"http://pdlaviation.unblog.fr/2009/06/02/vol-air-france-rio-paris/\"><em>Des avions et des hommes</em> expresses his condolences</a> [fr] to the passengers and the crew of the Airbus A330-203.</p>
<blockquote><p>L\x{2019}annonce de cet accident me remplit de tristesse.<br />
Le plus grave accident d\x{2019}Air France, nous dit-on.<br />
Ind\x{e9}pendamment du nombre de victimes, pour chacun de ceux qui sont concern\x{e9}s la gravit\x{e9} est extr\x{ea}me, pour la victime bien s\x{fb}r, mais aussi pour les parents, les amis, les coll\x{e8}gues : ils se trouvent brutalement confront\x{e9}s \x{e0} une perte irr\x{e9}m\x{e9}diable. Je m\x{2019}associe \x{e0} leur peine. Je songe au personnel d\x{2019}Air France ; en premier lieu aux navigants, comme leurs a\x{ee}n\x{e9}s ils vont poursuivre leur t\x{e2}che.</p></blockquote>
<div class=\"translation\">The announcement of this accident fills me with sadness.<br />
This is Air France\x{2019}s most serious accident, we are told\x{2026}<br />
Regardless of the number of victims, for each of those involved it is extremely serious for the victim, but also for parents, friends, colleagues: they are suddenly faced with an irreparable loss. I feel their pain. I think of the staff of Air France; first of Airmen, their elders as they continue their work.</div>

            'description' => "<p>As expected, US President Barack Obama&#39;s speech was received with different and contradicting reactions in the Egyptian blogosphere. While many praised his eloquence, charisma, intelligence and awareness of Arab and Islamic history, more believed it was just the same talk they had heard from other presidents but in a better wrapping. Also, they almost all agreed they are waiting for &#8220;action&#8221; to prove the supposed &#8220;good intentions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first <a href=\"http://blog.ahmedsays.com/2009/06/blog-post.html \">optimistic opinion</a> came from <em>Ahmed</em>, who said how happy he is with Obama&#39;s gesture of approaching the Islamic world: </p>

<p>Another blogger, <em>Ahmed Shokier</em>, <a href=\"http://shokeir.blogspot.com/2009/06/blog-post_05.html\">analyzed</a> Obama&#39;s speech, then advised his readers that Obama is neither Muslims&#39; grand Imam nor a Muslim himself to have high expectations of him. He also said that the speech wasn&#39;t targeted towards Muslims only, but was followed by American voters, Israelis and non-Muslims as well. </p>

In fact, they are currently conducting some  \x{201c}maintenance\x{201d} work in the White House [\x{2026}] so in the meanwhile, he thought of passing by, visiting the pyramids and taking some pictures, followed by a quick lunch and then depart.</div>
<p><em>Fattractive Egyptian woman</em> continued in her excellent post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, he said all the right things. He quoted verses from the Qur\x{2019}an. He said al-salamu Alaykum. He said Islam contributed a lot to western civilization. He proudly said he had Muslim roots. [&#8230;]<br />
The rhetoric was beautiful. So beautiful that many people missed\x{2014}or chose to ignore\x{2014}the fact that nothing much has changed. [&#8230;] US policy has remained the same. America\x{2019}s interests are still number one, and that is to be expected.</p></blockquote>

<div class=\"translation\">Sadat said it in 1977, and now Obama repeats in 2009. Would someone respond?<br />

<div class=\"translation\">Did you see Mr. Obama boarding the plane yesterday? A strong man such as this should lead a strong nation. But our president didn&#39;t receive him at the airport, despite him being the most important figure in the whole world and the protocol says a president receives a president. I don&#39;t think its because American presidents usually don&#39;t receive the Egyptian president in previous visits, but because our president is &#8220;tired&#8221; and not ready to make any physical effort. His grandson&#39;s death, and the passage of time, have had a toll on his health.</div>

<p>These protests are<a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2009/05/07/peru-indigenous-communities-continue-protests/\"> a continuation of the demands from indigenous communities,</a> who are concerned that the government will take away their lands that are believed to be rich in minerals and oil.  As a result, more than 2,000 indigenous residents have been blockading the highway in the area of Devil&#39;s Curve in Bagua Grande for the past week and a half, <a href=\"http://enlacenacional.com/2009/06/05/enfrentamiento-entre-policias-y-nativos-en-bagua-deja-tragico-saldo/\">according</a> to <em>Enlace Nacional [es]</em>. As a result, supplies have been running out in the area.</p>
<p>One of the indigenous leaders of the protest group, Alberto Pizango, called a press conference and stated that the Peruvian government has committed genocide with the murder of his indigenous brothers and sisters.  Bloggers and twitterers from across the country are quite concerned and have been tuning in to the recent developments.</p>

Claro que tienen derecho a protestar y defenderse, pero cerrando caminos y sitiando a poblaciones urbanas (como Yurimaguas), no se van a ganar el apoyo de nadie.

<div class=\"translation\">
<p>This will end badly. In fact, it is already going pretty badly. Between (Environmental Minister Antonio) Brack, who has already sold out, and (indigenous leader) Pizango, who does not mind sending his people off to be killed, while he hides, I do not see any remote chance of understanding. Meanwhile, does anyone care about anything more important than politics and money or for the lives of the indigenous and their families? Of course, they have the right to protest and defend themselves, but by blocking roads and placing urban populations under siege (such as  Yurimaguas), they are not going to win the support of anyone. The only thing that will gain is the hatred and marginalization from their own countrymen: they are deepening the divide between indigenous and mestizos</p>

            'description' => "<p>From being described as the &#8220;self-appointed world leader&#8221; to questioning his choice of speech venue to choosing to turn a deaf ear to his speech, blogs across the Middle East are reacting to US President Barack Obama&#39;s policy speech on the Middle East just delivered in Cairo, Egypt. </p>
<p>After listening to the speech, <i><a href=\"http://stilettosinthesand.blogspot.com/2009/06/54-minutes-and-22-seconds.html\">Stiletos in the Sand</a></i>, an American based in Saudi Arabia, writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>54 minutes and 22 seconds .. of my life I can never get back. Speech in Cairo by the jeja is here in four separate parts. Really no reason for any other leaders of the world to continue ruling their own little domains. The jeja seems to have it all under control and will be the first, self-appointed, world leader from hereon out. Oh, sure. He says everything he has aspirations for, that he thinks can be achieved in the world, will need to be done &#8220;together.&#8221; Don&#39;t believe him for one single skinny second. If his lips are moving, he is lying. Hoo Boy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Syrian <i><a href=\"http://khaldounjarbou.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/hello-world/\">Khaldoun Jarbou</a></i> too wasn&#39;t impressed but writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>I don\x{2019}t see any thing new in Obama\x{2019}s speech, more than that, anyone who kept up with his campaign he/she will notes that this speech is a collection of what he had said before in his way to the White House, but how ever I have liked his choosing of some words. I mean in that Violence and Extremist instead of Terrorism and Terrorist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bahraini <i><a href=\"http://mahmood.tv/2009/06/05/obama-the-time-to-deliver-is-now/\">Mahmood Al Yousif</a></i> wonders out aloud on the speech venue: </p>
<blockquote><p>I keep asking myself why did Obama choose the most repressive regimes in the Middle East to honour not only with his presence, but also to use as a launchpad for his Utopian vision of a peaceful and democratic Middle East? A vision that will continue to remain as illusive as a desert mirage for us Middle Eastners.</p>
<p>Then I try to select an alternate of the 22 Arab countries where he could have used instead, but I fail to find a single one which could be worthy of such an occasion.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the speech itself, <i>Al Yousif</i> adds: </p>
<blockquote><p>Regardless, he touched the perennial issues; Palestine through to women\x{2019}s rights, freedom of expression to democratic governments and of course the rejection of terrorism and freedom of belief. Points which generally have been raised by every single American president - and world leader for that matter - albeit without such eloquence and empathy - but so far without any concrete steps to see through their resolutions. Somehow a \x{201c}shared interest\x{201d} creeps in and all those promises get shelved or forgotten to be revived upon a new ascension to a throne. </p></blockquote>
<p>Writing at <i><a href=\"http://www.mideastyouth.com/2009/06/04/why-i-didnt-listen-to-obamas-speech/\">Mideast Youth</a></i>, fellow Bahraini <i>Esra&#39;a</i> explains why she did not tune into the speech: </p>
<blockquote><p>As an Arab and a Muslim, there was nothing much I can benefit from what Obama has to say. I\x{2019}m so tired of these tedious speeches and words and praises and promises that no one, including the target audience, ever lives up to. Despite not watching this speech due to lack of interest, I sat down on Twitter and was franly disgusted at the hype, the way people were mindlessly cheering his words on, as if they don\x{2019}t understand the sources of our issues to begin with. Suddenly Obama was here to \x{201c}fix things,\x{201d} while reducing our problems to the size of a footnote.</p>
<p>I support Obama, at least in comparison to his war-mongering colleagues. But we don\x{2019}t need his leadership, or anyone else\x{2019}s for that matter. </p></blockquote>
<p>In Israel, writing at <i><a href=\"http://southjerusalem.com/2009/06/the-june-4-lines/#more-1274\">South Jerusalem</a></i> <i>Gresghom Gorenberg</i> notes how the speech has changed history: </p>
<blockquote><p> Barack Obama likes to change what history means, and that\x{2019}s a very good thing.</p>
<p>Today, for instance, marks 42 years since the Six-Day War began. Ever since then, the term \x{201c}June 4 lines\x{201d} has referred to the  on-the-ground border between Israel and its Arab neighbors on the eve of the war - not the lines marked on maps, but the lines marked by forward military positions. On the Syrian front, for instance, the actual positions lined up with neither the pre-1948 international border between Palestine and Syria, nor with the 1949 armistice agreements. The small distances on the ground make for big problems in peace negotiations.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, however, June 4 means something entirely different. It now refers to the day on which Barack Obama chose to speak in Cairo. \x{201c}June 4 lines\x{201d} henceforth mean the line of thinking that the president laid out for reconciliation between the U.S. and the Muslim world, and along the way, between Israel and the Palestinians.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the speech, <i>Gorenberg</i> writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>His message to us was very, very basic Obama: First, I acknowledge your history. Second, it\x{2019}s time each of you recognize the other\x{2019}s side history, that you stop thinking that somehow by admitting the other\x{2019}s side suffering you\x{2019}ll erase your own. And now that you\x{2019}ve acknowledged history, stop holding on to it as if electricity were running through it, as if your hand can\x{2019}t let go. Move forward. Turn history into history - the text explaining how we got here - and stop treating it as an ever-repeating present.</p></blockquote>

A new website was launched last week where anyone from around the world can leave a 64-word message of solidarity for imprisoned leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The website <a href=\"http://64forsuu.org/\">64forSuu.org</a> is named as such to mark Suu Kyi\x{2019}s 64th birthday on June 19.</p>
<p>Supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi can <a href=\"http://64forsuu.org/about.php\">leave and view</a> video, text, twitter and picture messages on the website. A <a href=\"http://64forsuu.blogspot.com/2009/05/64forsuuorg-global-campaign-to-free.html\">sample</a> of 64-word message of support: </p>
<blockquote><p>\x{201c}Nineteen years ago, the Burmese people chose Aung San Suu Kyi as their next leader. For most of those 19 years she has been kept under house arrest by the military junta that runs the country. We must not stand by as she is silenced again. Now is the time for the international community to speak with one voice: Free Aung San Suu Kyi.\x{201d}</p></blockquote>
<p>This brief statement was signed by many personalities and other <a href=\"http://64forsuu.com/gallery.php?type=5\">famous names</a> which included George Clooney, Sec. Madeleine Albright, Drew Barrymore, David Beckham, Bono, Matthew Broderick, Sandra Bullock, John Cusack, Matt Damon, Robert De Niro, V\x{e1}clav Havel, Helen Hunt, Anjelica Huston, Scarlett Johansson, Nicole Kidman, Ashton Kutcher, Madonna, Sarah Jessica Parker, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Naomi Watts.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23assk64\">Twitter</a> is an integral part of the campaign:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is the first political campaign to use twitter with an integrated website to harness the reach and influence of some of the world\x{2019}s <a href=\"http://64forsuu.blogspot.com/2009/06/celebrities-back-64forsuuorg-on-twitter.html\">most influential celebrities</a>. Through replies and re-tweets, the campaign message reached an estimated 5 million people through Twitter alone in its first five days.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of those who tweeted support for Aung San Suu Kyi was <a href=\"http://twitter.com/yokoono/status/1935794571\">Yoko Ono</a>. The website launching was deemed successful as <a href=\"http://64forsuu.blogspot.com/2009/05/global-statements-calling-for-release.html\">global leaders</a> sent their statements of support for Aung San Suu Kyi.    </p>
<p>British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is also a supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi. Check out his message on YouTube:</p>

<p>Brown\x{2019}s 64 words of support:</p>
<blockquote><p>\x{201c}I add my voice to the growing chorus of those demanding your release. For too long the world has failed to act in the face of this intolerable injustice. That is now changing. The clamour for your release is growing across Europe, Asia, and the entire world. We must do all we can to make this Birthday the last you spend without your freedom.\x{201d}
</p></blockquote>
<p>Many Southeast Asians also expressed support for Aung San Suu Kyi. From Erich Jao of the Philippines:</p>
<blockquote><p>The free people of the world support your cause and the nobility of your sacrifice to further the freedom of Myanmar. Let this year be the last time you breathe the air of oppression and tyranny. Evil shall never thrive in light and let the world cast the spot light of truth upon your fight and let it not be delayed in acting swiftly!</p></blockquote>
<p>Monika Neff from Malaysia left this message</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Aung San Suu Kyi Happy birthday,what you are doing for the People of Burma makes you a hero besides others who sacrificed their lives for their people,like Nelson Mandela and Ghandi.people like you are only a few,all we can do is show our support like this.We love you Suu Kyi,one day Burma will be free and it will be because of your sacrifice!</p></blockquote>
