Setup

If you have not already done so, create a test database and add it to mediawords.yml with the label 'test' as described in the INSTALL file.
Note that this database is wiped and rewritten everytime the test_suite is run.

Running the Full Test Suite

Normally the best way to run the full test suite is to run ./script/run_test_suite.sh 

This will run all of the tests and then report a summary of any failures.

The following scripts may also be useful.

./script/run_test_suite_with_code_update.sh -- this script preforms a full subversion update on the source tree before running the test suite

./script/run_test_suite_for_cron.sh -- runs the run_test_suite_with_code_update.sh script but only produces output if one of the tests fails.

NOTE: It's normal for the full test suite to fail when you run it on a new test database for the first time. Simply run it a second time in this case.

Running a Single Test

Sometimes it's useful to only run a simple test. To do this use the ./script/run_carton.sh to invoke the prove program dirrectly as follows:

     ./script/run_carton.sh  exec -Ilib/ -- prove -r <TEST_FILE_NAME>

e.g.
     ./script/run_carton.sh  exec -Ilib/ -- prove -r t/compile.t
