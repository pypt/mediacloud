The terms of the sentence were not a surprise: Dunn <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/10/01/loud-music-shooter-found-guilty-of-murder-in-second-trial/\">was found guilty of first-degree murder</a> on Oct. 1, and after prosecutors decided against seeking the death penalty, the life sentence without parole was mandatory.</p> <p>Circuit Judge Russell Healey <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fla-man-gets-life-in-prison-in-loud-music-killing/2014/10/17/02249a5c-5615-11e4-b86d-184ac281388d_story.html\">told Dunn in court</a> that his &#8220;life is effectively over.&#8221;</p> <p>During the sentencing hearing Friday, Dunn, 47, issued what appeared to be his first public apology to the dead teenager&#8217;s family.</p> <p>&#8220;I want the Davis family to know I truly regret what happened. I&#8217;m sorry for their loss,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.koco.com/national/michael-dunn-sentenced-to-life-without-parole/29192798#ixzz3GQ9f2bsT\">CNN&#160;quoted Dunn as saying&#160;before receiving his sentence</a>.&#8221;If I could roll back time and do things differently, I would.&#8221;</p> <p>In November 2012, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/10/01/loud-music-shooter-found-guilty-of-murder-in-second-trial/\">Dunn shot Davis</a> at a gas station after an argument involving the music coming from a vehicle carrying&#160;Davis&#160;and three other teenagers.</p> <p>Dunn fired 10 times at the vehicle, shooting even as the vehicle pulled away. Davis <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/02/18/whats-next-in-the-florida-loud-music-killing-case/\">died soon after being shot</a>, while the two other people in the car narrowly missed being shot themselves.</p> <p>Dunn returned to his hotel and drove home to Brevard County the next day.

With his band PHILM, Dave&#8217;s recorded two albums and is working on a third, he&#8217;s in a project with Mike Patton of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/officialfnm?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Faith No More</a> and itching to get out on the road and tour.  We spoke with him about PHILM and the new album &#8220;Fire From the Evening Sun&#8221;.  Dave gave us some insight into PHILM&#8217;s collaborative songwriting process, what it was like recording in an Oscar winning actresses mansion and the music he listened to growing up that would later influence his work.  </p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: Thanks for taking time to speak with me today. You&#8217;re from the LA area originally, right?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, I've been living here all my life, basically. I came to this country when I was 2-years old. I've been in this area ever since then.  I love it.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: Where were you born?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: I was born in Cuba.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: Now the name PHILM is pronounced like Film right?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, it&#8217;s just like a movie film. It&#8217;s the exact same way. It&#8217;s with a PH</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: The new album &#8220;Fire From the Evening Sun&#8221; that&#8217;s your second one with PHILM.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, &#8220;Harmonic&#8221; which was the first one, that was released in 2012, was recently re-released Sept 16 in 2014.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is this album different from your previous one?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Absolutely, there&#8217;s big differences between both albums. The first one was recorded in a house. We were waiting for some kind of funding from the record company and it didn't happen, so I said, you know what, let&#8217;s just go ahead and do it ourselves and we&#8217;ll record it in a house, bring in our own gear and just do it. Like they say, if there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way. But with this album we had some help from Blue Microphones. They stepped up and asked us if we&#8217;d like to record at their home studio, which is Kathryn Grayson&#8217;s house, Oscar winning actress from the 40s. It was like the inside of a church basically, vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows. It&#8217;s a mansion in Pacific Palisades, California, but it&#8217;s all rigged up as a recording studio. I recorded all the drums in one session. It was like nine hours. We passed it on to Robert Carranza, renowned mixing engineer and producer. And then I passed it on to a friend of mine, Tyler Bates, who&#8217;s a movie score writer. He did the movies <em>300</em>, <em>The Watchman</em>, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, several other television series, the list goes on. </p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: The tracks on the CD, what are some of the ones you think are the best tracks, the ones your fans will be excited about?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: The more radio friendly songs I believe, your ordinary listener, I think would enjoy &#8220;Train&#8221; the opening track and &#8220;Fire From the Evening Sun&#8221;. For your more hardcore fans we have &#8220;Luxhaven&#8221;, &#8220;Omniscience&#8221;, &#8220;Fan Boy&#8221;, &#8220;Blue Dragon&#8221;, you know, &#8220;Lion&#8217;s Pit&#8221;.  The whole album I think there&#8217;s a little bit for everybody.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: What is your songwriting process?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: It&#8217;s collaborative. We record our rehearsals every time we get together; press record and we start improvising.  Musicians I enjoy working most with are musicians that are capable of improvising. And then what we do is we listen back to the improvisations and pick out the special moments of the improv and elaborate later.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: And who writes the lyrics?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: I leave the lyrics up to Gerry, the guitar player, singer, obviously he has to sing and play guitar so when it comes to the melodies, the lyric melodies, I hand it off to him. I sometimes give him some advice, you know, why don&#8217;t you repeat this line a couple times or we need something like this in the second section.  I kind of wear two hats in the band, one as a producer and one as a musician.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: As far as musical education - trained or self-taught?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: I&#8217;m the only one that&#8217;s self-taught. I learned from buying albums as a kid. Gerry, I know he&#8217;s had formal training; he&#8217;s also a pianist. He&#8217;s a guitar player, pianist and also he obviously sings. I just don&#8217;t know exactly where that came from. He doesn't talk about it too much but he&#8217;s definitely into a lot of classical composers and everything from Schoenberg to Franz Liszt. He loves Jimmy Page&#8217;s guitar playing. He has a wide taste in music. Pancho graduated from Berklee School of Music and so he&#8217;s definitely a valuable asset to the band. He kind of breaks things up, you know, as schooled musicians do and starts figuring out the diminished chords, the minors and the major keys and everything. I don&#8217;t understand what the heck he&#8217;s saying, although I have learned a lot from hanging out with him.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: It sounds like you complement each other.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, we do. Which is nice because I think it&#8217;s a little mundane when you have one guitar player writing all the music. It&#8217;s not a band. It&#8217;s like a solo project. It&#8217;s very rare that I like one guitar player or one musician in the band that writes all the music. For example Mike Patton from Faith No More, I also have a band with him, and he writes all the music but he&#8217;s exceptional.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: What were your musical influences growing up?  Who did you listen to?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Some of the 45s that I bought as a kid I remember buying a 45 of Stevie Wonder, another one of Bachman-Turner Overdrive, another one of the Doobie Brothers. I have a very wide taste in music. I bought KISS <em>Alive!</em>. I had Ted Nugent&#8217;s<em> Double Live Gonzo!</em>. Whatever I heard on the radio like KLOS, KMET, at the time was a rock station, when I was growing up. Late at night there was a DJ I used to love listening to, his name was Jim Ladd. He always played some of the best music at night and some of the best commentary.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: What about touring or playing clubs?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: We do these one offs. We just got back a week ago. We performed in Bogot&#225;, Columbia. We&#8217;re going to be performing in Ecuador and Mexico City in December. And I&#8217;m also going to be playing with Mike Patton in Santiago, Chile on December 6. I&#8217;m all over the place. I jump in one band and then perform with another.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: You&#8217;re in multiple projects.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Right now I just have two but the door is still open. I love working with other musicians. That&#8217;s something I always liked to do. Just stay busy. I've been home for one week and I&#8217;m itching to play on stage again. I would love to get on a major tour. Tour all across the globe. That takes a little time.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: You enjoy touring?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, absolutely, playing every day. It&#8217;s great.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: What does the future hold for PHILM?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: We have six songs completed and recorded. That&#8217;s what I've been keeping myself busy with recording that we did several months ago. We had the opportunity to put on to tape, the way we used to record, not on computer, and we recorded six songs. I think about two more songs we need to write for this album. I anticipate this album to be released April, May of next year.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: You&#8217;ll do a few shows.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: We&#8217;ll keep the momentum going and hopefully play more shows. Wherever they ask for the band.</p>\n",

        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: Thanks for taking time to speak with me today. You&#8217;re from the LA area originally, right?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, I've been living here all my life, basically. I came to this country when I was 2-years old. I've been in this area ever since then.  I love it.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: Where were you born?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: I was born in Cuba.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: Now the name PHILM is pronounced like Film right?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, it&#8217;s just like a movie film. It&#8217;s the exact same way. It&#8217;s with a PH</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: The new album &#8220;Fire From the Evening Sun&#8221; that&#8217;s your second one with PHILM.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, &#8220;Harmonic&#8221; which was the first one, that was released in 2012, was recently re-released Sept 16 in 2014.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is this album different from your previous one?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Absolutely, there&#8217;s big differences between both albums. The first one was recorded in a house. We were waiting for some kind of funding from the record company and it didn't happen, so I said, you know what, let&#8217;s just go ahead and do it ourselves and we&#8217;ll record it in a house, bring in our own gear and just do it. Like they say, if there&#8217;s a will there&#8217;s a way. But with this album we had some help from Blue Microphones. They stepped up and asked us if we&#8217;d like to record at their home studio, which is Kathryn Grayson&#8217;s house, Oscar winning actress from the 40s. It was like the inside of a church basically, vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows. It&#8217;s a mansion in Pacific Palisades, California, but it&#8217;s all rigged up as a recording studio. I recorded all the drums in one session. It was like nine hours. We passed it on to Robert Carranza, renowned mixing engineer and producer. And then I passed it on to a friend of mine, Tyler Bates, who&#8217;s a movie score writer. He did the movies <em>300</em>, <em>The Watchman</em>, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, several other television series, the list goes on. </p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: The tracks on the CD, what are some of the ones you think are the best tracks, the ones your fans will be excited about?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: The more radio friendly songs I believe, your ordinary listener, I think would enjoy &#8220;Train&#8221; the opening track and &#8220;Fire From the Evening Sun&#8221;. For your more hardcore fans we have &#8220;Luxhaven&#8221;, &#8220;Omniscience&#8221;, &#8220;Fan Boy&#8221;, &#8220;Blue Dragon&#8221;, you know, &#8220;Lion&#8217;s Pit&#8221;.  The whole album I think there&#8217;s a little bit for everybody.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: What is your songwriting process?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: It&#8217;s collaborative. We record our rehearsals every time we get together; press record and we start improvising.  Musicians I enjoy working most with are musicians that are capable of improvising. And then what we do is we listen back to the improvisations and pick out the special moments of the improv and elaborate later.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: And who writes the lyrics?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: I leave the lyrics up to Gerry, the guitar player, singer, obviously he has to sing and play guitar so when it comes to the melodies, the lyric melodies, I hand it off to him. I sometimes give him some advice, you know, why don&#8217;t you repeat this line a couple times or we need something like this in the second section.  I kind of wear two hats in the band, one as a producer and one as a musician.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: As far as musical education - trained or self-taught?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: I&#8217;m the only one that&#8217;s self-taught. I learned from buying albums as a kid. Gerry, I know he&#8217;s had formal training; he&#8217;s also a pianist. He&#8217;s a guitar player, pianist and also he obviously sings. I just don&#8217;t know exactly where that came from. He doesn't talk about it too much but he&#8217;s definitely into a lot of classical composers and everything from Schoenberg to Franz Liszt. He loves Jimmy Page&#8217;s guitar playing. He has a wide taste in music. Pancho graduated from Berklee School of Music and so he&#8217;s definitely a valuable asset to the band. He kind of breaks things up, you know, as schooled musicians do and starts figuring out the diminished chords, the minors and the major keys and everything. I don&#8217;t understand what the heck he&#8217;s saying, although I have learned a lot from hanging out with him.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: It sounds like you complement each other.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, we do. Which is nice because I think it&#8217;s a little mundane when you have one guitar player writing all the music. It&#8217;s not a band. It&#8217;s like a solo project. It&#8217;s very rare that I like one guitar player or one musician in the band that writes all the music. For example Mike Patton from Faith No More, I also have a band with him, and he writes all the music but he&#8217;s exceptional.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: What were your musical influences growing up?  Who did you listen to?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Some of the 45s that I bought as a kid I remember buying a 45 of Stevie Wonder, another one of Bachman-Turner Overdrive, another one of the Doobie Brothers. I have a very wide taste in music. I bought KISS <em>Alive!</em>. I had Ted Nugent&#8217;s<em> Double Live Gonzo!</em>. Whatever I heard on the radio like KLOS, KMET, at the time was a rock station, when I was growing up. Late at night there was a DJ I used to love listening to, his name was Jim Ladd. He always played some of the best music at night and some of the best commentary.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: What about touring or playing clubs?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: We do these one offs. We just got back a week ago. We performed in Bogot&#225;, Columbia. We&#8217;re going to be performing in Ecuador and Mexico City in December. And I&#8217;m also going to be playing with Mike Patton in Santiago, Chile on December 6. I&#8217;m all over the place. I jump in one band and then perform with another.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: You&#8217;re in multiple projects.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Right now I just have two but the door is still open. I love working with other musicians. That&#8217;s something I always liked to do. Just stay busy. I've been home for one week and I&#8217;m itching to play on stage again. I would love to get on a major tour. Tour all across the globe. That takes a little time.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: You enjoy touring?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: Yeah, absolutely, playing every day. It&#8217;s great.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: What does the future hold for PHILM?</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: We have six songs completed and recorded. That&#8217;s what I've been keeping myself busy with recording that we did several months ago. We had the opportunity to put on to tape, the way we used to record, not on computer, and we recorded six songs. I think about two more songs we need to write for this album. I anticipate this album to be released April, May of next year.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Q</strong>: You&#8217;ll do a few shows.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>DAVE</strong>: We&#8217;ll keep the momentum going and hopefully play more shows. Wherever they ask for the band.</p>\n",

        " The filmmaker Ken Burns spearheaded this heroic reassessment with his widely watched public television series on the Civil War in the early 1990s. Most memorably, Burns used the emotionally charged letter to \u201cMy very dear Sarah\u201d from a Rhode Island infantryman, Sullivan Ballou, written in July 1861 just before the battle of Bull Run. Much as Ballou wanted to return to his loved ones unharmed and to see his sons grow to \u201chonorable manhood,\u201d he gave ultimate priority to his country. He and his generation owed a great debt to \u201cthose who went before us through the blood and sufferings of the Revolution.\u201d He was \u201cwilling \u2014 perfectly willing \u2014 to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.\u201d Untold millions of television viewers, alerted that Ballou\u2019s iconic letter was his last, have listened intently to its dramatic rereading, complete with stringed instruments in the background, tugging at our heartstrings.\n",
        "ec As the army went into winter quarters, Biddlecom was sickened by dysentery, afflicted by lice and miserably lonesome and homesick. He and three other men lived in a \u201clittle dog kennel,\u201d about four feet high. In his darker moments he predicted cynically that the war would grind on inconclusively for 20 years, because \u201cLincoln and his miserable crew\u201d could never bring it to a successful finish. Biddlecom also second-guessed the decision to go to war in the first place. Much as he hated slaveholders, he mused that it might have been \u201cbetter in the end to have let the South go out peaceably and tried her hand at making a nation.\u201d\n",

        "\t<p>The World Health Organisation has admitted mishandling the early stages of the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, saying it failed to recognise the risks of the disease in the fragile states of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p> \n",
        "<p>&#8220;Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall,&#8221; says a draft internal document obtained by the Associated Press. Experts should have realised that the conventional way of containing an Ebola outbreak would not work in a region with porous borders and broken health systems.<br/></p> \n",
        "<p>WHO&#8217;s appointment system in Africa is also criticised in the document. Heads of WHO country offices in Africa are &#8220;politically motivated appointments&#8221; made by the WHO regional director for Africa, Dr Luis Sambo, who does not answer to the agency&#8217;s chief in Geneva, Dr Margaret Chan, it said. As Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/ebola-who-government-cuts-delays-in-dealing-with-outbreak\">told the Guardian last week</a>: &#8220;What should be [the] WHO&#8217;s strongest regional office because of the enormity of the health challenges, is actually the weakest technically, and full of political appointees.&#8221;<br/></p> \n",
        "<p>Medecins Sans Frontieres, whose volunteer doctors had begun to treat Ebola cases as soon as the outbreak was officially diagnosed in March &#8211; three months after the first case &#8211; had warned WHO in strong terms that this outbreak was different from previous ones.<br/></p> \n",
        "<p>&#8220;First of all it was the first time we had a case in a big city like Conakry [capital of Guinea]. It is something very different from the remote Congo jungle,&#8221; MSF&#8217;s Brice de le Vingne, director of operations in Brussels, told the Guardian. The cases were also in a triangle where three countries met. &#8220;We knew we were going to have a problem with dealing with three different administrations.&#8221; No country was going to want to declare an Ebola epidemic, because of the economic implications.<br/></p> \n",
        "<p>On 3 April, MSF first warned WHO, who responded by saying the numbers were still small. A dispute then broke out on social media between MSF and the WHO&#8217;s spokesman, who insisted it was all under control.</p> \n",
        "<p>The leaked document reveals that a teleconference in late April that included WHO, MSF and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention heard that some WHO experts were not bothering to send reports of Ebola cases to head office in Geneva.<br/></p> \n",
        "<p>WHO said it was &#8220;particularly alarming&#8221; that the head of its Guinea office refused to help get visas for an expert Ebola team to come in and $500,000 in aid was blocked by administrative hurdles.</p> \n",
        "<p>At a meeting of WHO&#8217;s network of outbreak experts in June, Dr Bruce Aylward, normally in charge of polio eradication, alerted Chan about the serious concerns being raised about WHO&#8217;s leadership in west Africa. He wrote an email that some of the agency&#8217;s partners including national health agencies and charities believed the agency was &#8220;compromising rather than aiding&#8221; the response to Ebola and that &#8220;none of the news about WHO&#8217;s performance is good&#8221;.<br/></p> \n",
        "<p>Five days later, Chan received a six-page letter from the agency&#8217;s network of experts, spelling out what they saw as severe shortcomings in WHO&#8217;s response to the deadly virus.<br/></p> \n",
        "<p>&#8220;This [was] the first news of this sort to reach her,&#8221; WHO said in the draft document. &#8220;She is shocked.&#8221;<br/></p>\n",

        "If the McCain campaign is still trying out songs, there's one by a couple of Brits, W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, that it should consider. We have to change the words \"an Englishman\" to \"American\" to get it to work, but, that done, the song expresses succinctly and entirely the case for John McCain and, by implication, against Barack Obama:\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<div id=\"body_after_content_column\">\n",
        "<p>\n",
        "<i>For he himself has said it,</i><i><br/></i><i>And it's greatly to his credit,</i><i><br/></i><i>That he is American!</i><i><br/></i><i>That he is American!</i>\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<p>\n",
        "And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the sum total of the Republican message this year. That is why McCain's first post-primary ad proclaimed him \"the American president Americans have been waiting for.\" Not the \"strong\" or \"experienced\" president, though those are contrasts he could seek to draw with Obama. The \"American\" president -- because that's the only contrast through which McCain has even a chance of prevailing.\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<p>\n",
        "Now, I mean to take nothing away from McCain's Americanness by noting that it's Obama's story that represents a triumph of specifically American identity over racial and religious identity. It was the lure of America, the shining city on a hill, that brought his black Kenyan father here, where he met Obama's white Kansan mother. It is because America is uniquely the land of immigrants and has moved beyond a racial caste system that Obama exists, has thrived and stands a good chance of being our next president.\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<p>\n",
        "That's not the America, though, that the Republicans refer to in proclaiming their own Americanness. For them, \"American\" is a term to be used as a wedge issue, a way to distinguish their more racially and religiously homogeneous party from the historically more polyglot Democrats. Such separation has a long pedigree: Campaigning for GOP presidential nominee Alf Landon in 1936, Republican leader Frank Knox said that the Democratic Party under President Franklin Roosevelt \"has been seized by alien and un-American elements. Next November, you will choose the American way.\"\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<p>\n",
        "Knox meant two things: that the New Deal represented an ideology outside the pale of American thinking and that the New Deal coalition, which represented record numbers of foreign-born, non-Protestant Americans, was therefore un-American. In more recent elections, Republicans have depicted Democratic presidential candidates as un-American cultural elitists heading up a dangerously diverse party.\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<p>\n",
        "This year, we can expect to see almost nothing but these kinds of assaults as the campaign progresses. The Republican attack against Obama all but ignores the issue differences between the candidates to go after what is presumably his inadequately American identity. He is, writes one leading conservative columnist, \"out of touch with everyday America.\" His reluctance to wear a flag pin, writes another, shows that he \"has declared himself superior to an almost universal form of popular patriotism.\"\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "<p>\n",
        "There are good reasons Republicans are focusing on identity rather than issues this year: In poll after poll, there's not a single major issue on which the public agrees with them or their presumptive nominee. Not Iraq, certainly. Not the economy. Should the election turn on the question of \"What are you going to do for America?\" rather than \"Are you a real American?\" Republicans are doomed. They offer no solutions for the stagnation (or decline) of American living standards, or for the weakening of America's economic power. They offer no resolution to America's war of choice in Iraq.
