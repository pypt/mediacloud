            This page allows you to merge the medium '[% medium.name | html %] [ id: [% medium.media_id %] ]' 
            into some other medium within all topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            After merging the media, all stories that appear the above medium will be merged into the destination medium,
            as well as all links to and from the merged media.  A medium should be merged into a destination medium if
            the two media are copies ('jobsanger.blogspot.com' into 'jobsanger') or if one medium is a 
            subset of another medium ('articles.latimes.com' into 'latimes.com). Once a medium is merged into
            another, all further stories discovered in the merged medium will be merged into the destination
            medium automatically in all topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The merging process can take a few minutes.  Please be patient.
