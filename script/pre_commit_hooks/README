If you use git-svn to check out Media Cloud's Subversion (SVN) repository, you can use these Git pre-commit hooks before committing code in order to automatically check your changes for mistakes, bad formatting and against some other requirements.

Alternatively, you can run them manually by issuing `./script/pre_commit_hooks/pre-commit` just before doing `svn commit`.


Using Git with Subversion (SVN)
-------------------------------

Here's a helpful tutorial: http://viget.com/extend/effectively-using-git-with-subversion


Attaching pre-commit hooks to a Git's local copy
------------------------------------------------

    cd .git/hooks/
    ln -s ../../script/git_hooks/pre-commit .
    chmod +x pre-commit     # Make sure it's executable


Writing a new pre-commit hook
-----------------------------

You can create new pre-commit hooks that would be run before committing code against the committer's local copy of the code.

The hooks are placed in `/script/git_hooks/` and follow the `hook-***.sh` naming pattern. The hook as to be made executable (`chmod +x`) in order for it to work.

For example, to prevent committers from committing code on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays):

1. Create a file `/script/git_hooks/hook-weekends-are-sacred.sh`
2. In the hook, check if the current day is weekend:

    #!/bin/sh

    if [[ $(date +%u) -gt 5 ]] ; then
        echo "Today is a weekend and committing code to Media Cloud's repository is prohibited."
        echo "If you absolutely, positively have to commit this code today, run \"git commit\" with the --no-verify option."
        exit 1
    fi

    # Not a weekend, exiting normally
    exit 0

3. Make the newly-created hook an executable:

    chmod +x /script/git_hooks/hook-weekends-are-sacred.sh

4. Done! Now the hook should be run each and every time you commit new changes to the Git (git-svn) repository.
