# Check if the list of Perl module dependencies in "cpanfile" have been changed, and if so, are they in the ascending alphabetical order.
#
# Usage:
# 1) Do some changes in Media Cloud's code under version control (SVN or Git) involving "cpanfile".
# 2) Run ./script/pre_commit_hooks/hook-cpanfile-asc-order.sh before committing.
# 3) The script will exit with a non-zero exit status if there are some additional modifications that you have
#    to do before committing.
