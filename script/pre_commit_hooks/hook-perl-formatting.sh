# 1) Do some changes in Media Cloud's code under version control (SVN or Git) adding / changing Perl files or modules.
# 2) Run ./script/pre_commit_hooks/hook-perl-formatting.sh before committing.
# 3) The script will exit with a non-zero exit status if there are some additional modifications that you have
