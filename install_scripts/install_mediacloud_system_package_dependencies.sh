You have to manually download, build and install Chromium Compact Language
Detector library from:

http://code.google.com/p/chromium-compact-language-detector/

When you have done that, make sure that you have libcld.dylib somewhere
(e.g. in /usr/local/lib/libcld.dylib) and run this script again with the
environment variable SKIP_CLD_TEST being set as such:

SKIP_CLD_TEST=1 $0

You might want to install Vagrant to set up automatic Media Cloud unit testing
on VirtualBox / Amazon EC2 machines. Download and install Vagrant from:

http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

You don't need Vagrant to run Media Cloud, so install it only if you know what
you're doing.

When you have installed Vagrant (or chose to not install it at all), make sure
that you have "vagrant" binary somewhere (e.g. in /usr/bin/vagrant) and run
this script again with the environment variable SKIP_VAGRANT_TEST being set as
such:

SKIP_VAGRANT_TEST=1 $0
