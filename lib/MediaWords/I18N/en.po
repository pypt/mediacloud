msgid "A core goal of the Media Cloud project is to make as much data as legally possible as available as legally possible.  Our hope is to provide the basic data to allow smarter folks than us to ask and answer better questions about the mediasphere than we could without having to do the back end work of collecting and processing the underlying data.  To that end, we make available daily dumps of per-story word counts for every story for every media source we collect (including many media sources that are not included in the main dashboard interface)."

The similarity score is the <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cosine_similarity\">cosine similarity</a> of the word counts of the 500 most common stopworded words within each of the two queries.  A score of 0 indicates no similarity at all and a score of 1 indicates that the list of word counts is exactly the same.  This similarity score can be used to quantitatively assess the degree to which two queries differ, and to compare differences between various comparisons (to ask, for instance, whether news coverage differed more between two media sources in the past two weeks than the previous two weeks, or to ask whether the content of mainstream media coverage of the economy is more similar to content of the whitehouse feeds than the content of blog coverage)."

msgid "Technically, Media Cloud performs five basic functions -- media definition, crawling, text extraction, word vectoring, and analysis.  First, we define the set of media sources we want to collect and discover the feeds for each media source (which in the case of many newspapers includes hundreds of feeds).  Second, we crawl each of those feeds several times each day to discover any new stories published by each feed and then download the html of each new story.  Third, we extract just the substantive content of each story from each html page, leaving behind the ads, navigation, and other cruft.  Fourth, we break that substantive text down into a set word counts so that we can count, down to the level of individual sentences, which words which media sources are using to talk about which topics.  And finally, we have a set of tools for analyzing those word counts, including the Media Dashboard tool that acts as the front page for http://mediacloud.org.  We make available all of the code for the system under an open source license and publish as much of the underlying data as legally possible."

If 'elephant' were the 15th most popular word in the first query and the 35th most popular word in the second query, it would be colored purple.  Words are sized according to the number of mentions divided by the number of queries it is found in.

So for a media source that mentions China frequently but African countries rarely, China should appear very dark on the map while African countries should appear very light.  We use a very simple country tagging system that counts mentions of a given country by looking for either the country name if it is a single word (eg. Ghana) or for two words from the country name to appear anywhere in the same sentence if the country name is more than one word (eg. United States).  This tagging algorithm is likely to have some false negatives and false positives."

"The idea for Media Cloud emerged through a series discussions between faculty and friends of the Berkman Center.  The conversations would follow a predictable pattern: one person would ask a provocative question about what was happening in the media landscape, someone else would suggest interesting follow-on inquiries, and everyone would realize that a good answer would require heavy number crunching.  Nobody had the time to develop a huge infrastructure and download <strong>all</strong> the news just to answer a single question.  However, there were eventually enough of these questions that we decided to build a tool for everyone to use.<br />\n"
