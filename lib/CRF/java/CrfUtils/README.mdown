This is a Maven-based Java project used for developing and testing the
Mallet-based CRF model runner.

The file `src/main/java/org/mediacloud/crfutils/ModelRunner.java` is being
build and used by `Inline::Java` from the Perl code. Binary builds in `target/`
are not being used by the production code directly.

It is easy to test and improve the project using the
[NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.org).
